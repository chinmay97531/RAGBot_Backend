    text: "our journey around the world to Crown a champion is going to start in a few moments time green flag at the back Formula 1 in 2024 begins when the five red lights go out the new season is underway and it's a good reaction time for Max stappen little bit of a wiggle when he applied the power for the second part of the start but he maintains the lead charl Clair trying to go around the outside How brave is he feeling he's not he's in second place and it's Sergio Perez who finds himself in fourth George Russell is in third place the spinner was L stroll in the background for Aston Martin it's Max EST staffen with the lead who will be second there's damage to one of the salvers in the background there falling to the back of the field I believe it's vry botas side by side the two McLaren go V stappen thenir Russell being harried and it's Lando Norris who was ahead of his teammate so that's hulkenberg is cleared and then they're going to have contact a that's all on hulkenberg isn't it just just drifted into the back and completely rear ended stroll great getaway from valter there you can see hulkenberg and I think does he touch the back of hulkenberg as well that is a pass for position that is Lando Norris getting past Fernando Alonzo Alonzo pleasantly surprised yesterday that the green Aston Martin was quick over one lap but he was worried this is George Russell trying to go all the way around the outside and get past sh Clair and he'll do so what a way to start your season and George Russell with a fine move the McLaren have steadily passed Fernando Alonzo Lando did it a while ago this is Oscar pastri sneaking up the inside on the previous lap he draws alongside the Scarlet Ferrari lir has been driving on his mirrors time and time and time again and to the inside car 11 at turn 11 Perez improves he's up to third place and this is going to be how Sergio Perez got past it's going to be a lock up there it is he got so close to Russell actually lir but he's kept doing that lock up in these opening laps and he's done it again on lap seven Le Hamilton is in the slipstream of Fernando Alonzo these two had a great battle here last year there is no battle this year Hamilton getting past and Alonzo's fears about the race Pace are proving correct two Ferraris about to do battle monz are all over again look at how sparks flying as the teammates go wheel tohe to the inside Carlos SS charlot Clair refusing to give it up but he's got no choice and that was elbows out Brilliance from Carlos signs signs have been called in there is the one move you're allowed to make Perez knows what's coming tries the Up and Under applies the power super aggressive stuff and position gained for Sergio Perez who moves in to a next second place in the race lair's also got ahead of Science in in the pit stop phase that's an interesting call from Ferrari to invert the cars effectively by pitting lir first and giving him the undercut over his teammate that's a late lunge and a half my word from downtown to take the place from Carlos signs he came from another post code I love it I love it I love to see drivers having the confidence to send it on the brakes and if you want to win races and you want to win championships you've got to have that kind of Bravery oh another chance here we go K sparks flying down into turn number one Carlos SS has the fastest half of the Grand Prix he's got the bit between his teeth he's got all the racing cliches that you want but either way he is driving in a way at this circuit that we've never seen from him before it's been the charlot Clair show in the past that is a rocket ship move say goodbye to Carlos SS because he's going to go and Chase the Red Bulls this is how he was able to take the place no fight at all from the Alpine waving him through it's a sorry State of Affairs for for Alpine not least qualifying on the back row they're not even putting up a fight with an RB horrible pit stop for valry botas he's been there for 39 seconds as they tried to get wrong Tire where have we gone here is that the nut being delivered so that's the nut back to the gun and this is game over no matter what happens so pit stops this is one of Greater consequence in the Grand Prix George Russell coming in nice and early getting another set of the hard tires botas it's reminiscent of the nightmare he had in Monaco a few years ago 52 seconds and race ruined the scooteria get out ahead of Lando Norris who was the threat there it's very close in the background and is it going to be a position gained piastri Dives to the inside claims the place off the road tires are cold Hamilton takes it by the time they get to turn number two and it's eighth position for the Mercedes driver this next little section we're quite telling cuz he's quite close to George can he get away with turn 10 without any under rotation yes he can but no George Russell can't George Russell off the road Char Clair will join him side by side but with the inside line heading into turn 11 and all of that hard work lap after lap after lap pays off the Ferrari is up to fourth place in the season open at Grand Prix and charlot Clair finds a way back [Music] the green Aston Martins on the main straight and that swap of position for the drivers two-time world champion and Driver who's won here before the only driver in the field who was racing here in 2004 in the first Grand Prix in Bahrain that is still on the grid today and he's up to n Yuki driver zap driver zap are you kidding me now so Yuki doesn't love that idea we're talking about working with a senior team they got to work with their own drivers at the moment so Ricardo knows that there it is yeah there we go opens the door Ricardo goes through sonoda listening to the team instructions yeah thanks guys I appreciate it sonoda didn't love the team instruction and he's not being shy in reporting it the Dutch driver continues his domination of Formula 1 New Year but no new winner Max V stappen still the driver to beat Max V stappen wins the season opener he takes the Bahrain Grand Prix and Max fapen is lighting up a trail once again Red Bull expected Red Bull delivered and Perez comes across the line to make it a great day for Red Bull they're one and two across the line chased home by caros SS who put together a superb performance down at turn one with overtake after overtake he'll be satisfied and the celebrations are underway in was always likely to be Red Bull but that is a statement Drive of 57 laps of not attack all the time but when he did need to attack Max aaen underlined in Block caps again the Saudi gr Prix is underway and it's a good launch off the line for both Red Bulls Charlotte Clair is under threat now for second place for STA and leads Perez will get his nose ahead Perez will get second place charlot Clair's got the griffy line has he got the room to fight back as they all make make their way through the first corners of the first lap it's for staffen but shair fights back into second position he went aggressive and he maintains P2 that's bman off the road as he begins life in Formula 1 slightly on the defensive it's for staffen lir Perez Alonzo pastri and Norris the top six well managed from lir in those opening Corners Perez looked like he had got the job done but lir swept back around the outside of turn two which he can do because it gives him the inside for four and he made it stick the rest of it looks fairly unchanged further back but I'm pretty sure Lando Norris jumped the start Perez had a great opportunity here to take second place David he did indeed and you'd think he did all the hard work but just when it came to to sort of closing that space down Charles lir wasn't intimidated and this is when it comes down to knowing your competitors if that was Max for Staffing alongside Charles lir Max would have just run the card a little bit wider making it absolutely clear that there was no space for Charles Lando Norris at the start no further action Baron is starting his Formula 1 career on the front foot but he's got to remember to stay to the right side of the line as around the outside goes Oscar piastri on Fernando Alonzo to take fourth place and they're fighting all the way by as bman had to hobble all over the curb to keep his front Wing here we go with Perez this is the battle for second place he's diving to the inside and Sergio Perez finds his way by with the first opportunity that he had in the Grand Prix looked like he was going to take second place on lap number one lap number four he's got 2.1 seconds between him and his teammate in the lead of the race this is into turn 22 look at H bra off the road and into the wall a heavy one at turn 23 Lance stroll into the barriers and out of the race H the okay can you bring it back Lance no all right copy that easy to credz difficult to do but he isn't a rookie yeah everyone is coming into the pits this is going to be so busy they're going to stick on a hard set of tires and maybe try and go to the end from here really long ranging one stopper crucially gets out before the Ferrari and in this situation there'll be no no question of unsafe release yeah and Perez flung into the path of Fernando Alonso as it is incredibly frantic stuff down there in the pit Lane oh I need a crash with a Red Bull so close Sergio Perez gets a 5-second penalty for an unsafe release Here We Go Again it is very tight between Oscar pastri and charlot Clair for fourth Lando Norris leads then it's Max stappen and that is very tight as charlot Clair stays ahead and fends off the Australian driver Alonzo trying to profit from it in the green Aston Martin has he got momentum to try and retake the place that he lost from p earlier in the race the answer is no and they're close but there's no change for position side by side Alban goes that is a tap that is damage and oon profited what is he doing Kevin Magnuson has been given a 10-second time penalty this is the BMA move little dummy shimmy to the inside go on then I like that I like that expression the bean move Max a staing in the unusual position of being in second place not for long maxen moves past and takes the lead from Lando norrris he's back in the lead of the race and he's not the only Red Bull on the Move Perez improves the third charlot Clair tried to go pass Lewis Hamilton outside line to the inside line going to be brave to make that work is the room there is and that's a great angle to show you they getting to the Apex first has worked for the lead Ferrari driver in the race he's 1.7 seconds away from Sergio Perez he's going to have a good opportunity now to build up through the gears to try and make his way by the H is in the way but only for the moment that's the pass he's been looking for and the man on debut in Formula 1 is up to ninth Kevin Magnuson has been given a 10-second time penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage TR oh you are kidding me aren't you 10 seconds for that that's harsh and the ch chance of a safety car with these four brawling in the way that they are well it goes up when they go side by side cod's been looking for that pass lap after lap Magnuson doesn't want to give it up brilliant racing from the pair of them Magnuson knows that he's not going to score a point in the race that is Defiance and it's cost Yuki Coda because estan oon finally gives Alpine something to smile about so this drive from Magnuson is going to earn h a point because hulkenberg at the end of this lap should have have a pit stop window to come in and clear his teammate whoa that's a send and a half for Alexander Alin patience ran out at turn number one it's only 14th but it looked great on board Yuki Coda will not want to go backwards the driver who started in ninth position on the grid is passed again as hulkenberg comes into the pits we talked of that pit window a few moments ago and hulkenberg is going to blend out onto the racetrack and pass might have engineered a chance to get hulkenberg into the point we've had plenty of chapters of this battle time and time again this is the best run for Oscar piastri through the entire race and Hamilton's defense comes to an end or does it piastri locks up takes the place won't be able to overtake like that he had the momentum he had the overp Speed but he couldn't slow down the McLaren and still they battle over fifth place place bman if he keeps this consistency he's actually just done his best lap of the race he's only 10th and a half slower than Norris absolutely cracking drive this from Oly bman and struggling a bit with tires there he's fighting with amton as well we can do it great encouragement for the British driver 18 years of age looking for points in debut in Formula 1 this was Daniel Ricardo running in 16th Place and R he goes clouting an apex curve rear tires that were probably on the limit already Max Fen is going to win the opening 2 Grand Prix of the year a ninth consecutive win Max ven eat sleep win repeat V stappen takes the Saudi Arabian Grand Prix to lead home a Red Bull one two an outstanding result for the team once again the Mexican fans celebrating in that grand stand for St and wins the Saudi Arabian Grand with another Drive of Distinction as Charlotte Clair comes home for his first Podium finish of the season and look at this moment for the 18-year-old from chelsford points on debut for Oliver bman Ferrari's youngest ever Formula 1 driver is a point scorer at the first attempt the stars of the show on a day that they went past the great Williams name fourth all time in for Formula 1 behind Mercedes behind McLaren and behind Ferrari they have earned their place there and it's another one two for the team and Formula 1 is underway in Melbourne good reaction time at the front of the field for caros signs but he's part his blocked by Max aaen who has the lead Norris maintains third for staffen SS and then it is Lando Norris a clean route through for all of those in the field it'll be 19 now that guu joins the race it's for staffen with the getaway that he needed then it signs Norris lir stayed ahead of pastri it's getting very very tight between Perez and George Russell and it's Russell who finds his way to hang on to the place he moves up to sixth position Perez down to seventh it's as you were ahead here we go the best chance to get past his old teammate these two started life in Formula One together at to Roso and they're about to go wheel tohe you're watching a Ferrari Take the Lead Le of the Grand Prix Carlos SS first opportunity offered up first opportunity taken and the man who didn't race in the last round leads in round three this smoke it is smoke out of the back of the slapper car for the first time in two years reliability could be a question mark can't you believe what we're seeing the man who has finished every Grand Prix since he retired from this one in 2022 has smoke from the rear of the car max V stappen has an issue he's still very close to the lead of the Grand Prix but he might not have a tire left at the end of it where's that smoke coming from it's like is it something on the on the rear right it's gone it's gone the man who is trying to win 10 Grand Prix in a row for the second time in his Formula 1 career will not continue the run a fire at the back of the car the dreams of Victory gone uh a smoke who smoke fire fire he has had Formula 1 set to easy week in week out but he will not see the flag he's retiring from the Australian Grand Prix and in Melbourne it's game on to win the Australian Grand Prix and the world championship leader chasing title number four the first retirement against all expectations and he 43 race finishing streak in Formula 1 comes to a fiery end yeah engine failure okay engine failure engine failure Hamilton out of the race our second retirement of the day it's V stappen and now it's Hamilton and Mercedes have had a few worries about the power unit this time it's taken out their seven time world champion driver the virtual safety car is is now deployed that was always coming and everyone reduces their Pace if you pit under the virtual safety car you save yourself about 7 seconds but look at the way Hamilton's parked as he gets out of the car that'll take just seconds to push behind the wall oh there goes the uh engine in quite a severe way sudden cut for Hamilton second retirement and alono he scrambled to the pit Lane will save himself 6 and 1 half seven seconds of pit stop time Alonso looking for that benefit it is a Ferrari one two on track then piastri and Lando Norris look at how much it pays you back if you pit under the virtual safety car Fernando Alonzo says thank you very much you can get rid of that virtual safety car now chaps we're ready to go racing again we look at the live speeds of Russell and Perez building up through the gears heading to 190 mph and heading to an overtake if Perez can just get close enough does he have enough road to sweep around the outside there is your answer he did it in the final meters of the corner but he got the move done Russell does he launch one to the inside can he launch one to the inside by way of response the answer is no Perez P6 and that's another pass for him he will go chasing Fernando Alonzo we know that in the final stages of this run that Fernando Alonso will not have the speed of Perez in fact Alonzo darting out of the way doesn't want to get mixed up in the Mexican drive race and now that is fifth position for Perez who has a bit of clear air he going to try and do something about the four in front of him there's the call this is not going to be popular amongst the Aussies but he's going to pull over and Norris will sweep through for third piastri playing the team game Norris is on tires that are five laps younger than Oscar piastri Char Clair covering off the two quick drivers behind going to be tight Perez Alonso chasing to 2.1 seconds thought was so important this is going to give an opportunity now to Fernando Alonzo the three of them together and Alonzo's got a great opportunity which way does he go lir maintains just maintains track position and Alonzo despite soaring to the left to the right can't find his way past Perez and that was closer than Ferrari would have wanted when you see vapen go out of the race you know there's a point on offer for teams who need to take their chance and Alex Alin running as close as he dead to the back of the house but not on the side of the racetrack that he needed to be and hulkenberg scampers clear all the while this goes on sonoda with RB's most important Pit Stop of the year so far and he's back out ahead of both that's so dangerous moving this is how Oscar piastri was able to take the position on the outside and then shown part of the racetrack he hasn't seen before then given room by Fernando alono this is pi gazley in Yuki sonoda BB move and taking the place away from his old teammate and good friend just out of the points these two Kevin Magnuson thinking about the move to the inside my word oh he's thinking about him from Miles back he is all over the back of the Williams it's going to be quick again it's going to be very fast this time around the outside to take the Place Kevin Magnuson gets the move done oh big crash George Russell with a massive accident at the end of the Grand Prix at turn number six and that will end the race as a contest the virtual safety car is out George Russell was battling over sixth place and this is how it came undone he got so close to Fernando on the way into the corner it was just simple dirty air for Russell and just simply didn't have the air flow over his car lost a load of down Force turned in and had a major oversteer all the way to the barriers what a performance what a comeback a Ferrari one two headed by Carlos signs who wins the Australian Grand Prix yes we have it P1 baby P1 a baby sh move good job caros this is amazing thank you guys life is a roller coaster is life is incredible was a Smo operator I forgot Smo operator Carlos SS The Sensational winner of the Australian Grand Prix with his most dominant Drive in Formula 1 it says he only won by 2.3 seconds but he was always in control of that one from the moment that bapen was out of the race here's what it does to the drivers's championship Max EST stappen still leads charl clir up to Second down to third goes Sergio Perez up to Fourth our race winner today in the Constructors Championship it's a Red Bull Racing on 97 but look at Ferrari on 93 it is time to go racing at auka and the Japanese Grand Prix is underway Max F stafen gets the launch off the line he was looking for alono did get a good jump but couldn't do anything with it side by side we go with the McLaren and the Ferrari Lando Norris is in third it's as you were V St and Perez norres then signs and Fernando Alonzo couldn't make it work on those soft tires he remains in fifth as they make their way through and off into the wall off into the wall goes the two cars and a big crash into the tire barrier yeah it's going to be an immediate safety car then is heavy impact for Ricardo and Al so Albin then gets a decent chance to come alongside and there there's the so there was the driver on the inside of Ricardo Albin was sort of aiming towards a space that was closing oh Daniel's come across on Alex Alin I don't think that was particularly fair from uh from Ricardo there I think he did have more space on the left hand side take two at zuzuka is five lights away and the Japanese Grand Prix is go once again and it was a good reaction time for Perez ven had to chop across the top four still in the same order who's feeling brave the top five are still in the same order as piastri tries to put pressure on Alonzo and is not able to do so they make their way through the s's can they all get through cleanly this time the answer is yes to that and it is Charla Clair the big winner off the line he's managed to Dart ahead of Lewis Hamilton the medium Tire trumping the hard yeah gave me a hit and the side let me know if it's okay we'll do George R diving to the inside and retaking the place he up to ninth and that is VRI vas saying goodbye to estan oon Russell up to 9th botas up to 11th making moves early on with the DRS L Norris is into the pits and the first McLaren in fourth place responding to the Mercedes now being on the right tire let's see where or Lando Norris comes out of McLaren dropped him in to a lovely Gap it looks like they have Norris has a bit of clear air next car up the road is is stroll what's happening with Yuki Coda on the uh the hard ties having made a stop gazley ahead on a minute we're not going to see a move here are we what wonderful stuff the Mercedes are swapping positions Lewis Hamilton asking the team what they wanted to do Russell goes up to fifth So Max vapen has made his Pit Stop you see that on the left hand side and ven comes out oh that is is unbelievably close to try and go around the outside Lando Norris goes the long way round and takes the place away from Lewis Hamilton Lewis Hamilton Under Pressure we're heading to the 130r so close and Hamilton has to seed the place oh they're going so quickly as they turn left at that corner Perez on the new mediums up to fifth I wonder if the Mercedes are trying to lock into different strategies today and Hamilton's maybe on a long one proper Russell on something different and that's why they swap positions fairly quickly Perez is going to line up once again at the 130r is he able to quickly get past George Russell Russell has to give the room another pass on board with Perez who sweeps by makes use of that Medium Rubber and takes fourth place as we're going to go very very tight no one wants to get P into the spoon corner but Hamilton's going to have to give the place and he does so Carlos signs win of the Australian Grand Prix is up to sixth can ven make the move quickly and cleanly that's the question we're posing as we build up to 200 mph and lir tries to defend but Max stappen retakes the lead of the race Russell can't turn the Mercedes at turn 11 and science is right with him and it's just you feel so helpless in their position with these guys on much pressure tires soft the compound as well for science on the inside to spoon and through he goes it's an absolute carve and copy of the pass he did on Hamilton there's Perez making the move to the inside and taking third position clean pass making the move Lon Norris really chooses his battles carefully in Formula 1 incredible spectacle outside the commentary box there there's a huge gaggle of cars came into the pits at the same time Magnuson botas sergeant and a change for position look at this look at this and we've got a terrific move there for Yuki sonoda the crowd are cheering once again he's found himself out ahead there and they all came in together bottled up by Kevin Magnuson that was the Gap that Mercedes were waiting to clear and you can see why it's as if so on the last in botas pitted before anyone else had a slow stop but because he had fresher ties for one lap managed to uh to effectively undercut his way back to where he was guys well done thank you top top job guys top job good sh clar out qualified by caros signs on uh on a couple of occasions in a row now wide moment for lir who goes off the road and loses the place Sergio Perez is up to second position can Lando Norris inflict more hurt on Charla Clair there could be a real opportunity for stroll to try and make the place on sonoda who's trying to get by ancient tires on that car but hulkenberg holds the place and this is the worst case scenario for Coda because now stroll can tuck in and it's getting really tight can he do another amazing move my goodness me it was nearly that corner again for RB that was so tight and he's trying to use the extra grip 27 lap old ties he's going to do it again and the crowd absolutely love it sonoda through at the s's for the second time in the ground free and SS will have the fresh tires to attack but he's going to lose the track position to the names that you can now see passing him on the circuit dner 2 has been causing issues all the way through and I believe that Sergeant has gone off the track there and that is not a great place to reverse a Formula 1 car on to well here he is building up to 200 mph out of the slip streak DRS wide open Carlos SS fights his way by to Fourth position right now he's focusing on getting past his teammate and moving up there's the defense from Char Clair but the DRS and the speed belongs to Carlos signs oh that's a late dive bomb move or an attempt for one for George Russell going wheel tohe with Oscar pastri pastri refusing to give that one up keeps the track position Russell will be on the radio to complain and George Russell's got a big opportunity now George Russell suddenly pastri is going to let Russell out of the slipstream he can't defend they both had DRS but George Russell takes the place on the final lap of the Grand Prix downhill to victory for the reigning world champion Max fappen returns to Victory Max vapen wins the Japanese Grand Prix and it's a Red Bull one two thanks to Sergio Perez four grand prix 412s one for Ferrari three for Red Bull and next up we return to the Chinese Grand Prix for the first time since 2019 the race in Shanghai begins in Five Lights time the Chinese Grand Prix is underway and Max mustafin gets the launch he needs to chop across Sergio Perez Fernando Alonso does he feel Brave to sweep around the outside of the Mexican driver gets the jump at the moment is the grip there Alonzo's being really brave but the grip runs out he's got the inside line he's got second position he moves past Perez as for STA and holds the lead but look at the traction that Alonzo's got fighting the car it is for staid Alonzo then Perez were on ball with fourth place Lando Norris alono was working so hard to bring those tires to life on the warm up L and is paid off the commitment and confidence he had around the outside of turn one was staggering thought he was going to have a look at P1 for a minute as well oh that really really was an aggressive start by the driver in the green Aston Martin Lando Norris chasing down Perez Perez did not enjoy racing in the pack earlier on and if you're thinking who's that in the house that is Nico hulkenberg up two places a poor getaway for both Ferraris lir down to eighth signs down to ninth the team's trying to get the tires up to temperature trying to make overtakes as we see now a big opportunity for charl clir trying to make him ends for losing places off the line and he makes the pass into turn 14 gets past hulkenberg Who's down to eighth SS trying to come with him as well hulkenberg on the inside into the final Corner that'll compromise his exit and SS could do with clearing the H as soon as possible maybe into turn one here let's see he pulls out of the slipstream building up to 200 mph DRS is now enabled but SS didn't have to wait for it hulkenberg knows his fight is not with the cars from Marinello looks like Alonzo's pushing their tires a lot harder than us this is is good it is good news will there be any defense offered by Fernando Alonso or does he have to think about the long game and Sergio Perez Powers by and retakes second place in the Grand Prix so here we go with the young British driver Lando Norris trying to get past the oldest driver in the field Fernando Alonzo focusing on the race again park it on the Apex he tried that on the lap to the grid and Lando Norris takes third place this is so important for lir to try and make the pass early using one of the DRS zones How brave is lir feeling now that move isn't done yet but lir makes the pass shuts the door and takes the long way round to take sixth place ah There's an opportunity now for the Ferrari that was late to pull out of the slipstream but that's another position gained for the man from Monaco through go charlot Clair he's up to fifth and he's going chasing Fernando Alonzo here's our race leader Max aaen all by himself as Perez comes in in fact he's so far ahead Red Bull can double stack not even worry about it that is so impressive from Red Bull 2.1 and two second stops backto back problem for valry botas he'd been having a good weekend he was challenging for the points but still still he can't find his way to the top 10 thankfully for Norris he will take the the 8sec benefit that you get for for pitting under the VC 15sec loss instead of a 23 and the full safety car is out they cannot move that car due to this man's retirement and into the pits we come with Max vapen and Perez has been called in Red Bull will have to double stack once again Perez is going to lose track position here so through goes Norris up to second place it will change for you on the left hand side and Perez drops down now Alonzo comes into the pits can lir get out before the Mexican driver can he get to that safety car line I think he's going to do it and he gets passed so it's for stapen Norris and charir as Perez [Music] rejoins here we go lock up for everyone oh contact to the back between stroll and I think Ricardo as Max for stappen yeah hulkenberg moves up Ricardo moves down it was a mess at The Hairpin the green flag flies once again at Shanghai International and it's a great restart for Sten this was at the oh that is ridiculous that is a huge hit into the back of Daniel Ricardo for stroll who then had to pit this is what it looked like on board I just clob at him so stroll who was hoping to return to the points today and had a good oh spin in the background for one of the vabs and there you go oh that is so disappointing for Yuki sonoda who is pulling off and will that require more intervention that car looks like it's in trouble at the back Magnus on board we've seen that before there is the contact damage to the front left for Magnus puncher maybe more for Yuki Coda this is on board the Japanese driver and this was against Carlos SS and that's the soft tire in full operating well it caused chaos but once he fired it up it's very effective tire and he got past SS take two this time the pass for stroll who's able to get past ah Magnuson leaves a wheel in and they somehow make their way around the corner stroll leaves the widest birth possible and this is really really great battling for the last place on the road because Daniel Ricardo has come into the pits and we're scrapping all the way through the order but stroll in the green Aston Martin and Magnuson finding himself back ahead for the time being it as you were into the hairin or is it late Lune time now for the Canadian driver gets to the Apex first will that be the past oh they're treating us to some great battling through this one Magnuson doesn't want to give the place up and they'll still continue this jol and I got to bring you in now this is our new vilner djon isn't it a lap of wheel tohe action swapping places every corner here comes Magnus again R the outside and this time strolls elbow is out to claim the place and this is the move for Perez trying to get p shair canair place the Ferrari in order to fight back it's going to be close between these two side by side they go no Perez gets ahead Alonso can take that soft tire no further and they felt the need to roll the dice but it's not paid off these two were not on the friendliest terms former teammates by the end of their time together and alono will love to make the move as quickly as possible man that is a quick Direction change and that is as quickly as possible and it will not be a contest with fresh tires with DRS he seated the place to get rid of the softs he put on the medium tires and another place gained by Fernando Alonso who goes after Lewis Hamilton who's up 10 places at the moment oh he nearly dropped it from the gravel and did a caros signs from yesterday Alonzo so nearly into the barrier and out of the race how has he done that 42 years of age but still providing box office moments Fernando Alonzo pass Lewis Hamilton and up to eighth it could have all been over a few Corners ago to the hairin turn 14 another position gained an up to seventh position for the first time in his career Max fappen crosses the line to take victory in Shanghai his 58th Formula 1 win and he has destroyed the field once more the Dutchman leads home home Lando Norris two red bulls on the podium thanks to Sergio Perez and a first victory in Shanghai for Max aaen who extends his lead in the dri's championship the moment is nearly here and the Miami Grand Prix is underway poor start for charlot Clair through goes Carlos SS Max AA and maintains the lead oh he was nearly hit by his teammate that was so close Sergio Perez went to the ins side he momentarily took second but he went deep into the first turn and that very nearly was contact between the two red bulls they got away with it though down to fifth goes Sergio Perez Max a staffen leads then it's lir Oscar piastri the big winner he is up three places to third signs his fourth then Perez my word that was dramatic into turn number one as they tried to make their way through the first of 57 laps but Perez was millimeters away from striking his teammate went to the inside line of that first turn no grip dirty Dusty and he very nearly made contact they got away with it yeah it looks like he's got uh cards on the top of his his helmet he went all in and almost all the way into his teammate he will never be so lucky again just feels as if the ston is just doing enough to keep that Gap Beyond DRS and uh not want to put too much stress on the tires as well as here he comes oh thinking about the move diving to the inside lir trying to be respectful where it was after you or after after you they didn't want to make contact they didn't make contact Oscar piastri is up to second position that is Hamilton making the move and getting past hulkenberg up to seventh place we just had a big crash there yeah copy we saw that and now hulkenberg's back in front yeah hulkenberg occupying seventh position the main battle you're looking at is Lewis Hamilton trying to get back past hulkenberg on he did before dipped out of the slipstream went back in again now to the inside of turn 11 and Lewis Hamilton gets that pass done for the second time today hulkenberg down to eight now at turn 11 are we going to get the pass for George Russell he's managed to get there one Mercedes went by before there are still two perellis on that racetrack and Russell makes the pass to improve to eighth place and the man from Monaco he hits his mark and that is a quick stop for Ferrari I hit that the frood race leader with the swap on trying to take avoiding action and he clobbers the Ballard Max staffen has been called to the pits he Blends in that's the blend line to the pit Lane and he had a lead of 3.6 seconds as he hands it over to his team Oscar piastri leads the Grand Prix for McLaren now is there a chance for Fernando Alonzo to get past Pierre gazley Alonzo who had a really tough start after his worst qualifying of the Year yesterday gets to the Apex first and Alonzo moves up and takes 14th position we've got estar knon making moves as well Alpine searching for their first points of the year that is him moving past and oron able to get past the H Fernando Alonzo is going to make the move now on that Medium Tire up against hulkenberg and he manages to fight his way by oh hulkenberg refuses to give it up in the end has no choice chance for another overtake heading to turn number one and the Mercedes of George Russell gets past estan o on that's for 11th Place Perri maintaining track position former race leader Max a stappen goes through so does Char Clair and land onar continues to circulate out there off the road go Kevin Magnuson and looking at our driver tracker Logan Sergeant might be there as well the home favorite the full safety car is out Lando Norris is going to get the benefit you only lose n seconds under the safety guy's got 11 to Max for stappen Logan defends the inside Kevin on the outside in the breaking Zone and you're going to do the switch back out of one into two yes indeed and I don't think Logan knew he was there it is a huge moment in the race as well because it's brought out the safety cup Norris this time does come in to the pits goes on to the hard tires and Lando Norris is going to venture back out onto the racetrack as the race leader when does Lando Norris stand on the power it's got to be single file at the restart you can't draw alongside that car you can't overtake until you cross that start Finish Line can land Norris ke Max for stappen behind we're fighting immediately on the restart here Norris for stappen then lir it's closed between Perez and SS further back in the battle for fifth place but it's wide open for the win here in the USA Norris did not have a comfortable restart but he does maintain the lead but this guy right here Carlos SS going to line up the McLaren who does not have a big defensive move from pastri Carlos s trying to go the long way round and claim fourth play but it's elbow thrown by Oscar piastri and this is what happens when you get a safety car late on finally they are really aggressively racing and to show you that Hamilton's just got up to seventh place I can't get the C to turn This Disaster big opportunity to the inside for Carlos signs who gets by at last and that was really squirming all over the road it's not done yet Oscar piastri is trying to fight back and Oscar piastri will fight back to take the place but he's deep into the corner and it invites signs to finally claim fourth place Lon Norris leads by 2.9 seconds then it's charlot Clair then it signs up to Fourth piastri trying to hang on to fifth place Perez trying to take it away Perez squeezes the driver one gets by now there's a second as well because Hamilton takes the place and the crowd love what they see a replacement wing for piastri and this is another big opportunity it was a move to the inside for estan okon Fernando Alonso knew what was coming he fights his way by good battle between these two now resolved in favor of Alonso 15 times Lando Norris has stood on the podium but never on the top step until now it's a landmark day for Lando Lando Norris wins for the first time in Formula 1 it's victory in Miami for Norris and McLaren the British driver's dream is realized and at the 110th attempt he's done it he's won it and look what it means to Zack Brown at long last Lando is your winner W oh I love you all I love you all thank you so much we did it will we did it P1 at the end of 57 laps fifth on the grid to First at the flag a Leap Forward in more ways than one well what an incredible weekend it has been here in in Miami we've given you a brand new grand prix winner Lando Norris has won the Miami Grand Prix thanks for your company wherever you watched we'll see you when F1 returns goodbye we go racing in Five Lights time and the Grand Prix is underway even reaction time at the front of the field Lando Norris is going to try and put the pressure on Max aaen holds the lead the two Ferraris side by side who's going to lead into turn number one it's going to be Max aaen who's ahead of Lando Norris and it's grid order for the top four Oscar pastri still in fifth position no change for anyone until you look all the way back down to Lewis Hamilton who's up to seventh position gaining a couple of places as well as hogenberg it was a poor getaway for Yuki Coda he dropped down to ninth Perez made a place on those hard tires as they make their way through the opening corners of the Grand Prix fairly cleanly the top five as they were when they left the grid Max a stpp and leads as we go on board with hulkenberg another good top 10 qualifying and gets that initial launch yes come on problem for Alex Alin in the Williams and the tie driver is coasting slowly he come in for the stop I think I've got a problem TI not proper he presents the car beautifully lined up as it's supposed to let's see I'm not sure did you see the time on that stop because in actual presentation terms he did his job wonder if it was the front FR right did they did it look like the uh the gunman was going back at that front right as the car was being committed to go back out on dra so One V carb in last time around the pressure on the team back out onto the circuit 2.3 seconds is exactly the sort of stop that they were looking for this in turn is going to be good news for Perez because surely hulkenberg will pit on the next lap this is the German driver who is into the pits the man heading to what will become Audi in a couple of years Saba next year then Audi in 2026 2.5 seconds is important but what about that outlet this is crucial in the Constructor Championship and Yuki sonoda goes a lap earlier goes to work around this threemile Racetrack and crucially the V carb gets ahead of the H and hulkenberg perah is going to make a mistake here because he had a very very slow lap last time around and we saw the ason Martin right behind he did he went off went off yeah it's easily done but unfortunately very costly and what will the ramifications of that be later in his race could he's just lost a few seconds Oscar fiastri hitting his marks that's a good stop as well for McLaren 2.2 that's Yuki Coda Ah that's the overtake that we were mentioning earlier in the broadcast can you turn the outside into the inside and improve your position sonoda up to 12th with that and hulkenberg fighting Sergeant knows that if he's going to try and stay with the Japanese driver he'd have to be inventive and he was yeah Logan Sergeant must be feeling punch drunk after those two moves this is on board with ls Hamilton into Aqua minerale yeah just bottom out and locked up under rotation and straight through the gravel for stappen retaking the lead that he held at the start of the race this is going to be such an important moment in the ground pre for Oscar piastri as charlot Clair gets used to those hard tires and how they compare to the mediums can piastri put the pressure on time for another overtake now with Sergio Perez he's cleared the H of Nico hulkenberg and he's up to ninth position yeah it's fairly straightforward Just Pure Performance fresher tires and on route to uh towards sonoda and the rb20 the Red Bull car behind out of the slipstream and that's an easy pass up to eth sonoda looking for another points finish again today hulkenberg completing it and Ricardo just trying to put the pressure on the H here's the chance for LR wow slam dunk stuff three he goes with the better drive off the corner through he goes in the Aston Martin this is charlot Clair he's heading to the variante Ala yeah I thought he scampered over the shame and he just takes the route across the turns on the racetrack to make up 14 and 15 yeah that didn't work for him at all not that that was a strategy that was a mistake here stroll making the pass he uses the DRS he uses the greater speed he uses the fresher tires and he gets by up to ninth position Canadian driver finds himself improving and that's a good return to the points if he can stay there uh the main loss is to Lando turn two turn six yeah my tires don't work uh just information Max that's all yeah for meppen is complaining about I see I see I see okay so guess the main thing to focus on now Max is as the Gap is less than 5 Seconds we really can't afford any track limits so focus on that mate there he is he can see the race leader the laps are ticking down and Max knows he's got to be just a little bit more careful on track limits which might cost you uh a tenth or two lap just that on itself this is going to be absolutely fascinating Norris knowing that if he can keep it clean he will be able to have the chance to Heap the pressure on can he let me R even more stupid and Lando happy to push turn nine a little bit more and push it as much as I can it and we've seen some great grand prix so far this year but we haven't really seen a battle like this all the way to the end Lando Norris he told us he was pushing DC and we saw that he's absolutely ringing the neck of that car I'm so sorry for the sound effects but that's within l know not even 3/4 of a kilometer he's been right over the edge of the rear tire twice he's upped his own pace and stappen he was 1,000th of his best lap of the race on the last lap Norris is still chiming away some decent lap time still slightly quicker than leair behind on the last tour but theen has managed to find a little bit more gaps as low as it's been though 1.4 seconds still Norris sliding on the rear end this onetime Contender now Grand free winner trying to force the error from Max V stappen they're getting closer to home Norris chasing V stappen all the way to the checkered flag right the next big stop is the tricky one this is where we know Perez made a mistake earlier in the Grand Prix Fen is going to have to go slightly cautious Fen is nearly there he's nearly home Lando Norris has chased him all the way to the flag but Max V stappen will take back the top step Max V stappen wins in IMA what a finish from those two across the line it's new opposition for vapen but the same result the Dutch driver does it again and he beats Lando Norris by 710 of a second Char clir completes the podium and how wonderful was it to see two brilliant drivers battling all the way to the end of lap 63 and one of the great motor races begins in Five Lights time and the Monaco Grand Prix is underway we get the launch from the line from Char clir he's going to maintain the lead could be second place for Ferrari they go side by side with pastri and signs jking it out but the Australian driver kept second place the top four the top five as they were as llaa gets the launch that he needed but is that a problem is that an issue looks like the Sparks out of the back of the car for SS he has got a problem he's off and he's out Carlos signs on the opening lap was the wheel banging between those two because the Spanish driver is out on the opening lap of the Grand Prix there must have been a touch then SS of piastri pastri was so brave at the first Corner hanging it around the outside the wall then pinches in on the exit and there must have been a slight touch between them watch pastri watch Oscar piastri in second place he's all over the back of the Scarlet Ferrari trying to chase his Way by can he Force his way pass to the newel chicane would have been bold but the McLaren firing up their TIR so quickly one Ferrari out immediately and the red flag is flying on lap one of 78 oh that's a big crash that we didn't see further back most important thing to see look no front left no front right but Perez thankfully out of the car and a huge amount of debris but extraordinarily four cars out on the opening lap this is the touch then for science oh it's a little one but just carbon fiber there at the edge of the floor for piastri and science knows he's got to puncture immediately watch Perez it's going to be down the inside it's Magnuson with the clip that causes the accident and that's a massive hit into the wall he doesn't back out does he he just never is not in his DNA for Kevin Magnuson to back out so Perez must have had a pretty bad start to be down there with both HC cars so hulkenberg might get a view of this or was he the I think he was ahead wasn't he on as per is ahead so Magnus sneaks up the inside of hulkenberg yeah Magnus is going to be on the right hand side that's where the contact is going to be well I mean Magnuson will say that Perez should have opened given him a bit more space to go side by side up there are you okay Nico H damn it that was unnecessary yeah so this is going to be the the angle I think there's the Gap and he's already touched the wall himself and then just keeps his fo in he just never backs out he's on 10 points on his license you think he'd be cautious at the moment that that's going to be him gone that is estok on chancing one at portier the two alpines come together what did he do what did he do what did he try to attack me oh gosh car damage off I can tell you esan okon is in the garage having his car looked at and that is why we were able to establish an order but the order for the restart has been given ass signs in third position that is a huge let off for the Spanish driver we're underway and racing once again on the streets of Monaco looks like a good launch for Oscar pastra he's got nowhere to go though Char Clair maintains the lead once again Lando Norris was close with Carlos SS but it's George Russell who's got the better traction with that Medium Tire can he get close no he can't top five top six as they were off the line will we make our way through this sequence of Corners unscathed this time we will and everyone will be trying to bring the tire temperature in I can't imagine he's feeling too comfortable there he's is measuring the pace he can fluctuate it as he likes he's now on this lap a second slower than the lap before and that's why piastri is right with him but when you have the bright yellow car in your mirror that close that was less than 3/10 into the best overtaking place on the circuit piastri is only about half a car from throwing a lunge that you can't be sitting too comfortable if you're in that position this is really close now Shing I guess because that was close with P3 one accept agrees with Jian far Aston Martin can do something here because they have both cars 11th and 12th they are now giving up Alonzo's race to get a big gap to uh to stroll so stroll can have a pit stop and go and attack gazley so Alonzo's managing this pace still even though he's on a medium Tire he's just keeping Ricardo here and frustrating for a driver that's has so many big lunge overtakes in his career he's not able to do one just yet and my word Lance stroll is making a pit stop something is happening in the pit Lane in front of us 2.3 seconds and all of Alonzo's work has built a gap for his Canadian teammate just for your I think H around I mean do you want to know the budg no Charles we're not interested we know you said all right no we are not interested that's rude sorry oh no stoll's got a puncture stroll has a puncher and his Amo up to the back of Pi gazley will not happen that's the carcass off the rim stroll back to the pit Lane and that deletes the chance of seeing some pressure lat on this V as driver in 13th position and he's in 13th position because he's going to go to the inside and we've got an overtake at Monaco vry vas gets by he's past Logan Sergeant at Miro what a move best of the race and it's very fast at this stage of the tunnel for Lance stroll who had to back off but did eventually get through down to the newv shaane on those soft tires he had better tires got the run on acceleration but then had a moment of doubt it's an overtaking banza another one for another one he's got another driver and he goes past Logan Sergeant oh my word more than a brush double touch there I think from Joe and Sergeant I would say the the highlights real of this one is not going to be the longest yeah good luck to the editor and this is Logan Sergeant overtaking Joe guu getting up to 15th Place and he did that whilst he was making his way through the traffic in 2017 charir lost his father and in his final days he told his father a white lie that he'd made it to Formula 1 that he'd signed the contract it wasn't true then but his driving has made it true now and look what he's done with the opportunity the grand stands he saw built as a kid growing up now rise for him and for the first time in 93 years this fabled race is won by one of their own sh Clair wins The Monaco Grand Prix to achieve his dream victory in his home race well done shla Clair it's mission accomplished Destiny fulfilled you've got that one forever we won it finally yes yes yes yes yes yes a when your home race includes memories of waiting with your friends to get on the school bus when he's looking up at the balcony where he first watched the Grand Prix that's more than special that's pure emotion for sh Clair and the party starts right now for Monaco's favorite son and even the prince is getting in on the action because when one of your own have won the most famous grand pre of the lot you've got to pass him all of the cars except the H are on the inters the two hes are on those xets will that work out for them we'll have to find out the ninth round of the season begins in five likes time and the Canadian Grand Prix is underway they crawl off the line with George Russell chopping across Max a stappen as they make their way to turn number one the plumes of spray are raised and the top four are in the same position Fernando Alonzo gets pass Daniel Ricardo to the Apex of turn two a huge amount of standing water on the racetrack as they squeeze the throttle further back we go and you can see Sergio Perez close there with gazley slightly sliding gazley coming across him a little bit all trying to find a bit of space on an narrow circuit Magnuson is going all the way to the front of the field as it stands he's passing people for fun and he's up seven places from where he started both of them making good gain seven places for Magnus and five for hulkenberg po Aon flinging the car through the grip level's just so low magnuson's past Hamilton Magnus gets another one he is having the time of his life so this level of rain is the worst we expect we go on board with a man on a mission Denmark's Kevin Magnuson a to take P5 when he stands on the brakes he's in another league right now on that full wet Tire great fun for Magnuson who's got more grip than anyone around him now on the tail of Oscar pestre who can't turn that McLaren and km mag just squeezes on the throttle and he's going to be with the McLaren in fourth position he's round the McLaren in fourth position on the exit we had a lot of fun with Kevin Magnuson but now H have conceded that it's time oh it's slow it's so slow and after all of that overtaking it's a slow stop for Kevin Magnuson who sees all of that hard work undone can Norris line up for the overtake here's the opportunity for Lando Norris who started in third trying to claim second place how powerful is the DRS there's your answer Lando Norris gets past Max vapman and takes second place in the Grand Prix this is an opportunity Russell's not had to defend from the DRS yet this is the battle for the lead Norris moving past under breaking and going through George Russell is over the chicane but he's in second place now it might be about to come third position because he's lost the lead ven's gone by and Lon Norris leads the Canadian Grand Prix fasri in the same car now is going to find the issue that Lewis Hamilton is finding oh car off the road and into the barrier Logan Sergeant with damage to the Williams the safety car is deployed and there is Logan Sergeant for stappen Russell and piastri second third and fourth come into the pits rll's pit crew normally so good Russell was released very quickly oh it's tight but they just cover off the Mercedes and they will leave the pits in the same order that they entered and the driver who had disappeared from vapen and Russell and piastri now comes into the pits as V stappen Russ and pastri go past so this is going to be close then because Norris has lost a load of time behind the safety car there you can see for stappen Max for stappen is going to retake the lead there's that line they were racing to that point McLaren versus McLaren Lando Norris's P3 we have most of the cars all of the cars on intermediate charlot Clair has risked the hard tires he's hoping for something truly extraordinary the rain is closing in nearby and vapen has aced the restart let's look at the overtakes further back one Williams still left in the Grand Prix is Alex alurn and he is fighting his way past the RB fighting his way past the Alpine and that is dramatic stuff to get up to ninth he got past Danel and Es bar on one of the great moves brilliant stuff the last three cars on intermediate tires are the first three cars in the Grand Prix it's going to be a pit stop race in comes must stappen in comes Russell no Norris stays out big decision there for McLaren Hamilton does the fastest middle sector of the race he was 1 second quicker than vapen in the middle sector as vapen had an in laap that looks slow for George Russell as he rejoins and Red Bull cover off the move you can still see it's really slippy at this part of the circuit Norris has been firing this car around the 14 turns of Montreal has he built himself a gap as he comes into the pits so you lose 18 seconds you've got the pit stop as well remember Tire temperature will be an issue Lando Norris on the right Max ven on the left hand side of your pitcher you've got a slightly wet pit exit but you've got ven going through turn number one and Lando Norris is going to be standing on the power in the lead of the Canadian Grand B for a second but the tires AR up to temperature and it was worth the gamble but B Sten rakes first place in the race okay Lando Norris there's the lock up does that open it for George Russell nothing between the two British drivers Lando Norris under serious pressure now he jumped Russell with the pit stop an inventive strategy for McLaren but there's nothing between the two of them it's drying all the time the error Into The Hairpin opens the door for George Russell to take second place in the ground Prix oh Russell's gone in deep has he yes he has does he open the door Lon Norris is off the racing line but he's back into second place Russell goes off the road Lando goes off the racing line and they're scrambling over the road for second place it swaps again yeah clambering over the curves then it got damp on the exit and that's when Norris came through fighting the car Perez has brought out the yellow flag he went deep he did continue and the rear wing has taken a battering oh oh off the road goes Carlos SS and he is rejoining Alex Alvin involved in that he's just to the right hand side I believe do we have here once again it's a safety car out on the circuit so this is going to be first of all Sergio Perez Got Deep got wide onto the wet part of the circuit spinning to the wall so science oh science has his own moment oh it's oh gutting for Alban so unlucky George Russell comes into the pits he brings his team as well a new set of slick tires the green flag flies at the circuit J vov we go racing all the way to the end now that is perfectly timed for the three-time world champion and so we're looking at the battle with the second McLaren the man from Melbourne staying ahead but for how much longer Russell trying to power around the outside they're close to contact they're nearly banging Wheels into the corner Russell rejoins pastri stays ahead P3 and leis Hamilton's roaring by as well well up to Fourth Place meanwhile in the battle for the podium places Lewis Hamilton has the DRS and that Mercedes does get ahead before the breaking Zone can Russell get by this time around that's his aim that's what he's done Russell gets past up to Fourth position let's see what happened to Yuki chasing down estan o on but he went off the road at turn eight put it flat to the floor spins the car is narrowly avoided by those behind [Music] Russell versus Hamilton the two silver arrows heading to the final chicane we are racing just remember goes without saying keep it clean please he had the warning but he got the place for the 60th time in Formula 1 Max ven takes the win Red Bull back on top Max stavin wins the Canadian Grand Prix Lando Norris is second and it's George Russell across the line to complete the podium after his worst results of the season when he saw the checked flag in Monaco he has returned to the top step in Montreal the battle in Barcelona is five lights away and the Spanish Grand Prix is underway Lando Norris immediately trying to deal with Max's STA and he tries to chop across but what a launch off the line that was from the world championship leader who's going to have an opportunity to go to the inside who's bravest on the brakes oh my word around the outside to take the lead George Russell what a start that is absolutely incredible stuff we were watching Norris we were watching for stappen but Russell somehow goes from fourth on the grid to the lead he has moved up three places in the opening 600 me of the race then is Max for stappord in second our pulse hitter Lando Norris drops the third yeah you see Max just got that initial drive off the line on the grass actually as he's trying to give enough space for Lando and as these two guys are going wheel tohe George gets a Mega Tool full commitment and around the outside might be a best opportunity now Max think wisely Russell super defensive Max has and try to Roar around the outside the leading two in the Grand Prix go whe to wheel and we have a new leader his name is Max V stappen and then this Mega Tool slipstream DRS George Goes defensive and then Max goes okay I'm going around the outside so as you saw on the opening lap it was Charlotte Clair ahead of Carlos SS now we see the move SS leaving the track and gaining an advantage has been reviewed by race control and there is no further investigation for this yeah there was definitely contact and Carlos ping Max for staing around the outside that is a great great maneuver to see as we see Mercedes making the call George Russell taking the last of the life from that pelli tires Carlos SS was told do the opposite to Lewis Hamilton doesn't look the quickest at the back there right rear is causing trouble and will that be a position gained oh my word that is close into the fast lane but the Mercedes just gets away with it is there an opportunity now for Lando Norris Lando it's possible we could cover Russell this lap what what are you think no I think we need to go get Max Lando Norris is fighting for the win in the Spanish Grand Prix Lewis Hamilton has the Dr r s they're building up to 200 mph SS knows it makes the move Hamilton to the inside though Hamilton risking it all we get contact between the two of them we get Hamilton going by and there's another one for the Highlight Reel so many moves at turn one that show you the skill of the drivers in the field well fairness there was definitely a little bit of rubbing but some would say that's racing Norris has been called to the pit Lane box box you can see how much he's given up by extending the stint he'll hope he can get that benefit back with the fresh IM medium his heart is going to sink when uh he pulls out of the end of the pet Lan finds himself looking at the back of ss but he will be on those fresher younger new tires why are we on plan a we in line with everyone else that was the choice here's the move we're hearing from charlot Clair but we're watching Carlos signs and Lando Norris who goes through and claims fourth position he got the great run further back in the pack a man with fresh tires taking sixth place Char Clair not happy with the strategy initially but he gets past the Alpine that's his minimum expectation at the lower end of the points here Oscar pastri on the medium Tire trying to get past Sergio Perez and piastri will be to the inside and piastri will be passed under breaking and the Australian driver takes ninth position there's been another pass for McLaren this is Oscar pastri moving past estan okon that is how he took eighth place and you would expect given the evidence of car performance so far he will make light work of Pierre gazley in the next couple of laps that's the car that's a good exit isn't it here's the opportunity now fando Norris and that is a slam dunk move Lando Norris able to pass the Mercedes with a clean move can he do the same thing to George Russell such a dominant run the Sten in recent times he's won 50 of the last 75 grand prix that is laid on the breakes and that's the move that we predicted was going to come Oscar pastry's way that is how he took Seventh Place czecho Perez on those fresher tires we can expect to see him now working his way past Alonzo onto stroll and finally working his way back into the top 10 side by side we go with Lando Norris George Russell went Mega defensive Lando Norris goes around the outside of turn number three uses that fresher Rubber and now Russell tries to come back around the outside he'll get the inside line for turn number five all of this battling is giving an advantage to Max a stpp and out front and it was a brilliant battle a battle that continues traction race fresher rubber inside line and third place for Lando Norris and they've been fighting for most of the lap DC they've been been fighting for most of their racing careers and that is Formula 1 2024 you got to love it that's a pass for Sergio Perez who gets past estan okon and he is now 9 seconds away from Pierre gazley yeah well Perez that's got to be his clear goal from the team to try and work his way into that 8 Seconds of uh the Alpine of gazley every Point as a prisoner oh Lewis Hamilton once again finds his way alongside and passed this time it's his teammate at the first turn and it's a place on the podium for the seven time world champion DRS coming from a long way away but with a big overs speed George defends the inside and leou goes you know what I believe in this tire I've got the confidence I know you're on the back foot on that hard tire and uh well Alex we know what the debate will be in the debrief from Georgia's side it'll be like why did you put me on the hard so from the Battle for first and second to the Ferrari swapping the cars round Mercedes they battled it all the way through turn number one Ferrari well they just swapped the cars and that charlot Clair back to where he started the Grand Prix he's in fifth place oh my word gather it together Alexander Alvin he can't do it and he is in the gravel trap seems to take forever to get back out of it here he is Max V stappen out of the final corner for the final time he's been pushed all the way but match Sten wins once again in Formula 1 and takes the checker flag in Spain hurried home by Lando Norris who takes second place 2.2 seconds at The Checkered Flag Lewis Hamilton is about to climb on a Formula 1 Podium for the first time this year and there won't be much between fourth and fifth over the line but it will be George Russell who keeps the Ferrari at Bay by 3/10 of a second yes nice oh yeah we uh we're definitely not the quickest out there today we did everything well strategy as well yes and for the 61st time at the venue where he began it all for Red Bull Max for stappen celebrates a victory and you can see sometimes it's all a little bit easy and it's simply lovely on the radio he's being chased home for every win that he takes at the [Music] moment the green flag at the back tells us we go racing in Five Lights time and the Australian Grand Prix is underway perfect reaction time for Maxa and he's got what he needed off the line George Russell will put pressure on Lando Norris but the top three were as they were that was Brave around the outside for Lewis Hamilton but did he overtake off the road when he was battling Carlos signs they'll work it out later for second place we go with George Russell momentarily ahead but Lando Norris with the inside line can Hamilton get the job done against Carlos he can but there'll be a question of whether he did so off the road Max aen checking out out front as Oscar piastri goes wheel tohe with Sergio Perez it's for stabin then Norris Russell Hamilton up a play signs down one and piastri climbed up to sixth position perfect start once again for V and pastra he's Usher wide to the gravel he's going to lose a place to lir as well and Perez has made two places in that right down in sixth place nose change for Charla Clair let's see on board with lir now that's his teammate ahead Hamilton on the side lir gets the whack with piastri then at the moment Lewis Hamilton trying to make the pass he's been so racy at the start of this one pass Carlos signs on the first lap on the third lap he's going to be past his teammate and Lewis Hamilton is up to third position his best start to a Grand Prix so far this year in terms of places gained he's on the attack but George Russell wants the place back will they play fairly wasn't even a contest Russell retakes P3 okay we're under investigation for turn one so we need to let SS pass so there was the instruction on the radio from Pete bonnington the race engineer for Lewis Hamilton he actually is still benefiting from that move at the start because science has not got the DRS from Russell that he otherwise might have had so now he's vulnerable and here comes Hamilton on the outside signs hug that inside line desperate to hang on to it and he keeps track position for the moment yeah both of them will be losing lap time you see the battle piastri and Perez and uh well we know pastri is not happy looking to go around the outside can he do it yes he takes the place and pastry forced to go the long way round and he gets the position back let's see what happen to Joe through goes Daniel Ricardo oh and a what the is he doing so we believe it was Alonzo it was Alonzo Alonzo into the side to Joe Joe not happy at all as he rejoins Alonzo's been given a 10c Time penalty for causing a Galis with Joe guu these two alpines they're not the best of mates are they so gazi has a look to the inside and Aron just sort of wafts towards the inside says don't try that one it's so easy to have a lock up there and clatter into the car ahead but gazley managed to to measure that one quite well going faster copy that okon finally does pass Fernando Alonzo yeah did so at turn number one Alonzo trying to come back huge amount of speed one alpen has gone through so is the second one Alonzo has run out of tires as we run wheel tohe and again the Alpin are providing us with onrack action the team won't like it but it's brilliant entertainment for us okon on the left hand side on board with Pierre gazley One driver on the left leaving the team and that was a chop across the B there of gazley who's now trying to go to the outside line he's trying to keep two wheels on the racetrack he's done that the outside line will become the inside line and Aon can't stay in the Bassel gazley gets by and takes eighth place that is Oscar piastri getting to the Apex first and piastri worked hard for that move coming through and taking what is currently third place away from Lewis Hamilton firsten sweeps in Norris sweeps in just behind Lando's got a set of mediums on was that slow was that slow sorry Charan K cross was that a slow stop they waited for the release took no chances so that will definitely app to the advantage of McLaren yeah left R very slow coming off and then because it was slow he then had to wait for Norris as well once it was once the left rear was attached they've had the helping hand of a slow stop he's gone oh he did lock up did he make the corner oh my word pushing on the out laap there the Gap was 7 seconds it's now 1.7 seconds this is where he got past in the Sprint yesterday Lando Norris is he Brave immediately again this time for stpp and covers it off this Grand Prix has come [Music] alive is it late again is it great again for Lando Norris who tries to slow it down but he overtook him off the road what a late lunge it was but he'll have to give that place back and he knows it he can't keep moving after I've moved it's just dangerous oh we going to have a big shot he forced me to go wide and look off battles for the lead decided late on here between Ven and shla Clair it went to the last lap in 2016 between the Mercedes pair and now on lap 63 Lando Norris slows it down that one will count if he can stand on the Power Max vaba was off the road to maintain the place there'll be all sorts of Investigations there what a battle between the top two in Formula 1 yeah he has to give the position back I was ahead at the Apex yeah and he went off track game on once again this time it's the outside line oh they make contact he's got a puncher he's damag his front Wing the leading contenders for the world championship come together at turn three the crowd can't believe it and George Russell will be looking at the Gap he's the man in third after ven and Norris come together chasing the lead incredible Norris has got a puncture as well has he or is he just going around for stappen who's crawling fen's going to Tumble all the way down I think Norris is struggling Norris gets to the lead of the race but what condition is the car in George you can win this you can win this George just drive and Norris is struggling George Russell is catching the pair of them the man who's got one victory in Formula 1 might be about to take the lead nice oh my god there it is there's the moment George Russell into the lead of the Austrian Grand Prix can you believe what we're seeing for Sten and Norris fighting lap after lap and it's the door swung wide open for George Russell who leads Carlos Signs by 2.2 seconds on board with Oscar piastri going alongside TR to take second place this is absolutely unbelievable stuff piastri now a contender to win this Grand Prix he's up to Second what a move and for just the second time in Formula 1 the British driver will see the flag first and George Russell wins an amazing Austrian Grand Prix he beats oscap asry home by 1.9 seconds Carlos SS is back on the podium for the first time since Monaco another grand prix to remember round here something about this place into turn number three just provides endless action endless drama and the beneficiary the winner George Russell we're all set for the start of the British Grand Prix halfway through the 2024 season lights out away we go George Russell gets a good getaway leis Hamilton tucks in behind watch out for Max V Sten on the inside of Lando Norris behind but George Russell comfortably through the first Corner into turns two and three and Vesta has to keep a little bit of an eye on pastri behind him Lando Norris now putting pressure on Hamilton but runs a wheel over the curve vea's got the outside line that works really well for Max VPP and he gets in front of the McLaren and he's going to have a chance of passing Lewis Hamilton immediately as well Lewis checks the mirror down the Wellington straight here towards Brooklyn's and he doesn't need to go defensive the stappen though has made a crucial pass there on nor yeah Lando just puts himself in a bit of a precarious position there with with ls Hamilton nowhere near alongside to commit to that on the outside was just drifting wide and Max picked up the pieces nicely now let's see what contact here for Alex albor oh that's the contact so it was in the melee with hulkenberg but it was actually Fernando Alonso that he hit rain expected in seven laps lasting for 10 minutes and if it's heavy rain 10 minutes of it is going to really change things charl Clair still keeping the pressure on the green Aon Martin as they head down towards their corner and charl Clair has a good dive down the inside this time and stroll didn't seem to fight that too hard charl clir Zips past made it look quite easy and this could be a chance for Lando you're absolutely right he was quick through backck it's quicker than I expected he's got DRS Lando Norris is going on the attack and he passes Max ven massive cheers from the grand stands as London Norris gets past his huge rival Norris up into third and the Australian is really getting that much closer whether he's going to be as close as Lando Norris was let's see he's got DRS in operation he's getting that extra straight line speed as they head down towards St corner he goes for the inside and yeah he's through as well as long as he can make the corner it's a bit slippery it's raining it's really slippery he took the inside line and then immediately thought he'd gotone in deep look The Umbrellas are going up DRS is still enabled and Hamilton's going to get it and he's going to draft straight past Russell here George Russ trying to defend from his teammate can he do anything I don't think he can leis Hamilton takes the lead of the British Grand Prix from his teammate Mercedes still running onew in the damp conditions but Hamilton becomes race leader once again here at silverston we' got a long way to go in this race and conditions have continue to change teammate George Russell oh both off both run wide and we'll look out for Norris who stays on the track is he going to close right into the pack as well Russell rejoins just ahead of Norris pastri is off in the background it's really chucking it down and none of them have pitted Norris to the inside land on Norris takes second place that was brilliant St by Lando Norris he saw the two Mercedes running deep and he managed to break a little earlier the track is getting slower and slower we're now running about 108% if it hits around 112 before we get through this pocket then they will have to box otherwise everyone's trying to hold on rain Gap and then big rain coming later look how close Lon Norris is to leis Hamilton there's a real chance he's going to overtake Mak an unusual area he's done it Lando Norris now takes the lead of the British Grand Prix and gets through that corner where there were so many inance and now Hamilton's actually back under pressure from his teammate so Hamilton found the grip first now he's just looks like he's struggling Russell's there pastry around the outside can he do the fapper move on the first lap yes he can if he can get the power down George keeps it in on the inside oh pastri gets the place wobble wobble and he's up into third position this is so tight and it is wet here be careful otherwise it's so easy to go and run and wide Hamilton's in trouble P's got a beautiful line on the exit this could be a McLaren one two it does look like it Oscar piastri getting alongside Lois Hamilton just has to finish the move down into Stow corner and he's done it he's into second place as long as he can hold it together yes that corner has been working very well for him the sten's going to pit and Red Bull now roll the dice which may work because it looks like this is the time to come in for intermediates yeah I agree with you I think that might be a very good move to come in right now SS coming in as well it's only Norris who's told to come in but this could hurt pastri later Hamilton's told to come in Mercedes double stack Russell's in behind him there's ven behind Hamilton but now ahead of George Russell so that is a good important gain for Max ven pastri will be struggling on this inlp he was looking really good as the rain fell but he was 20 seconds away from a dry Pace on the last lap so this is really going to hurt Oscar piastri and piastri you can see look at the order he's just dropping dropping down that order and we shall wait to see whether Hulen no he's out well in front of hulkenberg in fact on board with Kevin Magnuson what was he up to oh my goodness he did well to save that I have seen many a car end up on that inside barrier you get out wide and look at the moisture coming off that the painted surface on the outside oh oh Russell's told retire the car George Russell in the pits oh my goodness the man who started from Pole Position who took Victory last week in Austria he is out of the British Grand Prix oh he's never had a Podium here and it continues this time with a dnf oh Shake of the head for George Hamilton's in and Norris stays out he comes past the commentary box so this is fascinating is this going to be the right decision to go onto the slick tires on this lap interestingly vest Stan has come in as well we need to box the sof head now any sleep TI in he comes this got to be perfect it has Hamilton was a second and a half quicker in the middle sector McLaren might have blown it by staying one extra lap and Lewis is going to come through if Lando has a decent pit stop with tires fired up and a chance to win L's so long in his box as well it's not a great stop and Hamilton is just going out of the club corner and heading on down past the start finish straight he's going past us and leis Hamilton I think is going to be in front as he come out yes he's got there's Hamilton Hamilton comes out in front of Lando Norris and the pit stop that Mercedes chose was perfect from that point of view it has switched the two leaders around and it's multiple British grand prix winner Lewis Hamilton who is now back in front watch them through here if the Gap closes between veraa and Lando Norris through this part it stays fairly no it's actually a good exit from Max there though and the DRS will be coming in this is a chance to close right in on Lando Norris Here Comes Max with up and he moves to the outside and he makes the move he's up into second place and Lando was not able to fight that he is about to head for victory as he comes into the final Corners here at silveron the crowds are going crazy leis Hamilton wins the British Grand Prix he takes his ninth win at silverston his first win in nearly a th days in Formula 1 his 104th Victory ever absolutely brilliant get in there leis you the man thank you so much guys it means a lot it means a lot to get this one big thank you to all the fans here love you guys and what a sign off for our joy trajectory here on the British grpr we couldn't wish for anything better this is a lovely moment isn't it and you can see the emotion even though we can't see his face you can feel the emotion in lwis with his dad and oh this is this is a really special special moment Hamilton has taken victory at the British Grand Prix at silverston his most successful track in history and he's done it with Mercedes on a key day wet and dry difficult times Lewis has controlled it all and taken the win green flag at the back means it is time 2 three four five red lights in Budapest and the Hungarian Grand Prix is underway Lando Norris chops across his teammate but it's a good reaction time for Oscar pastri the two P cars go side by side with pastri d to the inside for stavin trying to go the long way round piastri takes the lead of the race Lando Norris in second for Staffing off the road as he rejoins having gone off all four wheels trying to take advantage and take second place is Lewis Hamilton for Sten funnels wide Lewis Hamilton Oscar pastri leads Lando Norris retakes third Max has to give the position we're on it I was ahead of and he just open whe P off understood ma Norris now who already lost the place on the inside he's exactly like Barcelona for him now he's got to look to the outside and there comes Max steaming round the outside Lando could have done the same thing to his teammate technically and just kept it pinned used the runoff area like Max has done but he was fairer in that example backed off here's a chance for signs up against Fernando Alonzo these two have raced each other already this year it got very rough in China but but that's a tidy move and an easy pass for the winner of the Australian Grand Prix Max the incident is under investigation I think our recommendation is you let this go we can talk about it later why can't they not just say what they think and then we decide that's he's slowing down he's slowing down they will switch positions and Lando Norris takes second place Red Bull decide not to risk the penalty Hamilton in an eight-time winner of this Grand Prix he's managed to keep Pace with those ahead and he is the first one of the top five to come in and change tires he goes from medium to hard on lap 17 and everyone now is going to be forced to respond let's see Max's stop not ideal 3 seconds for a team that are used to getting it around 2 seconds income signs one of our six different winners so far this year he's on the hard Tire as well V STA and rejoins behind pastri behind Norris and a switch for the current Podium places Hamilton steps onto what would be a net third place fighting it into 11 off the rad wow wow wow play cool be cool Oscar that's what brought Lando Norris back into play here Comes ven DRS wide open wasn't able to shape for the move before is he laid on the brakes he is Hamilton covers it off but locks up doing so will that open the door for the stapen are they going to go wheel tohe one once again Hamilton on the left hand side foren trying to sweep around the outside and take the place he goes off the road he can't slow it down and it's Hamilton staying in third for the moment a minus and the things is does it's unbelievable Hamilton again in early say It's a Long Way to take the tire but he comes in and so does Char Clair looking for the undercut on basten unusual because he went longer in the first in but they've just tried to catch Red Bull out with that very short second stint good stop from Ferrari good stop from Mercedes as well very sensible on both it's quite impressive onard completely race Lando Norris will be the McLaren that gets the fresh tires first can he undercut pastri from here two seconds that's the question isn't it can he get onto the fresher rubber can he put the pressure on that way they chose to bring in their leader in the championship okay Oscar Lando has pitted to cover Hamilton to make sure he covers Hamilton we'll manage that situation best Pace from you now best Pace yeah SS dives off into the pit Lane as well which will unleash Norris around the final corner and I think Lando is going to lead the race this is going to be a huge moment Lando Norris goes past his teammate and it's going to be the net lead of the Grand Prix they told pastri it was to cover off Hamilton is that the moment that has de decided our winner today okay Lando Oscar just pitted we'd like to reestablish the order at your convenience oh big moments into the gravel for Oscar piastri that is more than you want to be dipping the wheels okay Max a stappen comes into the pits to finish this sequence of stops with massive consequences for who wins this Grand Prix and who's on the podium as well well that's some gentle introduction no don't give me that you guys give me the strategy okay I'm trying to rescue myself we need you to save more ties please and we do want to let Oscar through you should have box first doesn't matter I mean it does to me maybe game on for fourth place could be the final place on the podium they're fighting on the racetrack once again Max V stappen to the Apex first and he's got the place from the Ferrari he will go up against Lewis Hamilton next one position gained as vapen tries to minimize the damage in the points in the world championship and tries to climb back onto the podium and Lando we still think you're using the tires too much turn four turn 11 and the rear exit turn six turn nine Oscars 3.5 I know you'll do the right thing as ven well will he dive this time this time he gets there he locks up but he makes contact with his old rival for stappen and Hamilton come together again battling for the final place on the podium and they're into each other to drop Max a Sten off the road down to fifth place moved under breaking I'm not even going to get into a radio fight with the other teams Max we'll let the shoers do their thing it's childish on the radio childish so that was for stappen he arrived out control into that one the way to win a championship is not by yourself it's with the team you're going to need Oscar and you're going to need the team orando Norris is backing off he was on the cusp of a second Grand Prix Victory and it's a situation that DC knows from his career a swap of positions Oscar piastri goes back through into the lead of a Grand Prix the the man from Melbourne leads he was a champion in Formula 3 a champion in Formula 2 he announced himself in Formula 1 with a tweet that said he would not be driving for another team it turned out that he would be driving for McLaren and he's taking that McLaren to the top step of the podium the Australian driver advances all the way to the checkered flag Oscar piastri wins for the first time time in Formula 1 it's a McLaren one two and the driver who grew up hearing V10 engines in his back Garden because he lives so close to the track in Melbourne is now one of the winning group as Lewis Hamilton claims his 200th podium in Formula 1 well done Oscar well done checker flag well done buddy thank you everyone thank you very much thanks for the coordination well done maximum points really good weekend it is Oscar piastri the 115th Formula 1 grand prix winner McLaren's first one two in three seasons Lewis Hamilton making history on the podium once again for the 200th time and formula one is underway for the Belgian Grand Prix great start for Le Hamilton he's up to second place he's immediately past Sergio Perez charlot Clair holds the lead the two McLaren are side by side and he's onto the gravel in the ground fando norres gives an opportunity to George Russell side by side we go with Lewis Hamilton and Sergio Perez into o Rouge no Hamilton's ahead he gets the move completed lir then Hamilton then Perez then pastri wide moment fando Norris cost him places Max aaen up one position to 10th place as Perez fights back looking to reclaim second position charlot Clair has the lead for the moment can George Russell go around the outside of the McLaren so close it is lir then Hamilton then Perez the top three Norris l losing three positions at the start running wide into the gravel and look just behind him Max fappen has gained a couple of places already so there's only two cars between Norris and vapid at this early stage this was the five red lights going out and immediately Perez knew he was in trouble yeah and from Hamilton's position here it's actually easy to send it in and Nerf the back of the Ferrari ahead but he measures that part well gives Perez space on the exit as Norris runs wide and loses all the momentum at the start of a long run just Sten right in behind Alex Alin he's got a bit of downforce on that Red Bull he's got a lot more than the Williams he's going to sweep all the way around the outside outside line to the inside line passing at will and making places early on because he knows he needs to go on the charge and does alour fancy go back no and that's the side of a seven time world champion getting closer and closer still he's won this Grand Prix on four occasions he's tried to take the lead from charlot Clair now with the help of DRS out of the slip to the race lead for Lewis Hamilton and we have a new leader the seven time world champion is at the front of the field Hamilton leads the Belgian Grand Prix high pressure for all of the crews in the pit Lane Mercedes have delivered and in the background it's a 2.7 stop for vapen in the Red Bull Hamilton's coming from the race lead so is Sergio Perez also in there in the background is Oscar piastri who was told to come in so a crucial moment that releases s Norris and the new race leader is sha lir who finds himself back on to the race track Le Hamilton back onto the race track now where is Russell where is Ven and this is crucial Russell's getting past Oscar pastri so going to the new rubber earlier on has worked for George Russell can pastri do something about it immediately so can he do the move that Russell did on Coda Russell checks the mirrors the McLaren is right with him they've got the same power unit in the back of the car but piastri has to go on the attack here vital that he gets to the end inside of Russell for his Grand Prix he needed to make the move and he did it's only for ninth could be greater points later on what an enthralling Belgian Grand Prix we go to the chemel street building up to 200 mph and the orange McLaren dugs out of the slipstream trying to move ahead against Sergio Perez and piastri has another pass as he moves up to sixth position he is a contender to win this one as Lando Norris comes in to make his Pit Stop leaves into the fast lanee he goes 2.3 seconds and Lando Norris lights up the rear tires goes back to work this is into stav for Sight it's a big snap on the entry Hamilton radio and said the rear tires were going but they certainly are on the hard shod Ferrari as well that's more of a gravel brush than I was expecting he will be lucky to keep it pointing in the right direction as we climb the hill is this the best opportunity for George Russell the winner of the Austrian Grand Prix earlier in the year Perez knows it it goes defensive nothing he can do DRS open Russell breezes by and takes fourth place think one up so George Russell asking the team to consider extending Lewis Hamilton coming in for a vital stop the race leader comes into the pits Mercedes go to work and it's a 2.4 second stop to give himself a great chance of covering off sha clir Norris trying to get past the first of two red bulls he will hope that he overtakes in this Grand Perez is the driver he is passing and Norris gets up to sixth position he will try and go chasing after Max vapen Vin trying to catch his teammate Oscar pastri much quicker than am I taret to be him or not it's a close it is close pastri is close to lir again now pastri had one dry run at this can he get by this time around charir looking in the mirrors piai wants that inside line lir is not going to give it to him so going the long way round and taking the position is Oscar piastri who fights his way to Third and now he's going to heat the pressure on the Mercedes Russell's Tire saving Hamilton's trying to catch him and they're going to have to deal with the pace of Oscar piastri George Russell called the shots wanted a One Stop everyone else came in for fresher rubber he's trying to nurse that hard Tire all the way to the end that's the good part of the sentence the bad part of the sentence is that leis Hamilton is three point . 7 Seconds Away here SS trying to improve from eighth to seventh and he's done it he gets by Sergio Perez and that long stint has given him a points gain up against the Mexican driver p7 for the Ferrari man and Russell is getting good drive off lass horce again he opens up the capap towards 710 and if Hamilton can't come past Russell he'll at least have the DRS to defend from pastri who is getting closer and closer we're on the penultimate lap and I don't think he's going to be able he's not there jolian how can this be possible from George Russell and it's Russell versus Hamilton Mercedes versus Mercedes with a McLaren close by to win the Belgian Grand Prix Hamilton has a lock up at Las Source this is the last big big opportunity with DRS on the horizon o over the uh the crest of radon and again Russell's done enough on the exit he's holding Hamilton at arms length Russell immediately knows that he needs to break the toone Lewis Hamilton is the driver with DRS Oscar piastri is in third position how close How brave how late dare Hamilton go he can't get there he can't make the move and George Russell is closing in on one of the most extraordinary and audacious strategy calls that we've seen in years in Formula 1 it's going to go all the way to the jacket flag one chicane remains Lewis Hamilton is chasing George Russell all the way to the end of the Grand Prix but it'll be a Grand Prix claimed inexplicably with driving Brilliance from the wheel of George Russell who takes one of the greatest drives you will ever witness to the top step of the podium George Russell wins the Belgian Grand Prix all the other big teams went for a two- stopper with both drivers Mercedes heard the call Russell demanded one Russell takes his third career Victory by half a second across the line to deny Lewis Hamilton the podium is completed by Oscar piastri how did he do that amazing strategy you guys are the best come on it's a pretty good drive yeah that was right yes W TI Whisperer TI Whisperer we finish before the summer break with seven different winners Maiden winners in Lando Norris and Oscar piastri an extraordinary record-breaking extending win at Silverstone for Lewis Hamilton but George Russell one of the seven with an audacious run on a tire that no one thought would last but he made it work here comes the green flag at the back we go racing in xanor in Five Lights time and the Dutch Grand Prix is underway what sort of reaction is it it's a poor start for orando Norris and Max for stpp and takes the lead once again Norris has not found the launch he was looking for and the home hero hits the front of the field George Russell is up to third position it's for stappen then Norris and Russell as the field try to make their way through the First turns on the RAC trck for the first time to the inside low line for pastri can't make it work it's for STA and then Norris and Russell yeah that's the worst case scenario for Lando Norris there and also George Russell licking his chops because I think that Oscar must have got boxed in and he's taken advantage of that so Lights Go Out Norris's reaction is good but he just goes nowhere in that first phase of the launch and he is already cleanly behind V stappen you can see Russell and pastri side by side you can hear the chattering he just cannot get the power down he's still seeing the battles going on so this is all a result of Yuki Coda not being able to get past the house and now he's under pressure from Lewis Hamilton who's trying to move forward he'll get to the Apex first that's a tidy pass you don't get many into turn 11 but Hamilton has provided us with the first one of the day and he climbs up to 12th position round the outside for Carlos SS places the Ferrari well gets past two-time world champion Fernando Alonzo nice move using the bit of banking there at turn one new team principal Oliver Oaks who's about to see his car come under serious pressure from the Ferrari caros signs who stays in the slipstream for as long as possible gaz's going to fight this one around the outside tough moment on the Apex gley keeps his foot in in the Alpine and who's going to get there into turn number two still they go side by side and signs gets ahead another position gained he moves up to seventh Hamilton to the inside can he get to the Apex first he can second ason Martin cleared Hamilton slicing his way through the field nicely at the moment he's making good progress at a circuit where it's not always the easiest to overtake TI are just num they don't they don't cop that you always start feeling the heat you're not feeling comfortable in the car you're struggling you're losing grip and then you just see the car behind getting closer and closer and now he's having to defend into turn one is very close on board with Lando Norris trying to take the lead of the Dutch Grand Prix from the home favorite he's getting to the Apex first he's moving ahead and all of the damage done at the start of the Grand Prix is forgotten now because Lando Norris takes the lead he's got such tremendous Pace right now at this agage in the race you can just see Max didn't offer a defense but he didn't have the grip really to defend anyway in come Charla Clair after an encouraging stint he's going to that fresher robber faster remember we saw the fastest La of the race still the fastest lap of the race by Alex Alvin on that hard compounded tire so it's working on the Williams the Ferrari will hope it works as well here is George Russell not having the fastest stop slightly slow on the front there but three point 4 seconds what can Char lir do can he take advantage this could be close lair's done the fastest middle sector of the race so far there he is and he's going to sweep around the outside he is in the net race ahead of Oscar piastri and also ahead of George Russell charlot Clair going for the early stop getting the benefit of the fresh R and a slightly slow stop for Mercedes means the Ferrari gets ahead Alex alurn who has a long stin on these tires 26 laps to be exact here's an opportunity we've got overtakes everywhere you look including around the outside to take the place for Oscar piastri who says goodbye to George Russell and that is a tire offset that is a difference in performance RIT large at turn number one piastri will be trying to hunt down Char clir next can I interest you in cars absolutely everywhere look at this a total Brawl on the main straight fre wide into Tarzan corner will not work turning his way back to the points is Alex alurn who's then being overtaken by Pierre gazley gazley goes to 10th alin's in 11th Alonzo in 12th position and stroll in 13th that one came alive right let's enjoy this again Kevin Magnuson was at the front of the field when he came out of turn 14 and he was bringing half the grid with him that's Alvin that's gazley that's Fernando Alonzo three wide into turn one quite a few and through goes L stroll as well it's just dangerous really dangerous alono has an easy pass on Alex Alan the fresher tires paying off now for the the drivers there that pitted a bit later piastri stayed out longer elongated that first in so that he would have the chance to attack now on the braks into turn number one and Carlos SS trying to fight his way by he's done so as he got past Perez he has and he's taken sixth position from the Mexican driver Who's down to seventh Russell who started in fourth place Hamilton who started in 14th position seventh and eighth at the moment for Mercedes curious call to pit Russell there he's lost a couple of places SS went through Perez has gone through he's got 19 seconds to make up to Sergio Perez we still need to decide who will be in the second Saba seat and we know that hulkenberg will be heading to the team that will become Audi there's a massive difference in grip here between these two cars and Pierre gazley knew it to Roar around the outside and take ninth position that would equal his Personal Best in 2024 Fernando Alonzo getting past hulkenberg hulkenberg trying to hang on to the point here trying to go to 23 points of the season and Fernando Alonzo says nope I'm going to do what gazley did and go the long way round employ the better traction and take 10th position Lando said before today that he hadn't been driving like a world champion he knows that this summer many winds have slipped away but he has regrouped and today at the house house that Max rebuilt the Winner's orange once again but this time he's driving a McLaren for the second time in Formula 1 Lando Norris wins Lando Norris wins the Dutch Grand Prix with a crushing performance and the bonus point for fastest lap the Gap in the world championship is 70 points Norris taking a second career win and he had a personal best in all three sectors of the lapa 1138 as Max fappen on the podium at his home Grand Prix once again this time it is second place Char clir will complete the podium he was chased home by Oscar piastri in fourth and that will be fifth across the line for Carlos SS uhuh simply lovely huh he did just sneak it in there as well thank you one Bo incredible job car was unbelievable thank you so much incredible job let's keep push the traditional celebration fando Norris it wasn't the start that he wanted to the Grand Prix he was forced to study the rear wing of the Red Bull for 17 long laps but when he hit the front it looked like no one had the answer to him and by the end of the Grand Prix when he was taking the bonus point for fastest lap on the 72nd and last tour it was clear that that updated McLaren in clear air is an absolute rocket ship and the Italian Grand Prix is underway Lando Norris is looking into his teammate and he's got the launch that he needs but George Russell is still a contender second and third at battling pastri blocks out Russell Lando Norris has got to the front Russell goes onto the cross and over the road he momentarily takes the lead but he'll have to feather it back McLaren finally get the start they need from Lando Norris it's Lando Norris Oscar pastri Russell loses out as a result of going over the road at turn number one it's charl Clair then Carlos sides as the McLaren are side by side and Oscar bastri is going all the way around the outside to take the lead with a bold and Brilliant move Lando still can't keep the lead on lap number one and he's lost second place to sha Clair I can't believe what I've Just Seen absolutely brilliant stuff from Oscar piastri who knows that if he's running anywhere near his teammate that McLaren have to start thinking big picture he now changes that completely by Leading this Grand Prix that could be move of the Season that was extraordinary from piastri on his teammate round the outside low down Force low grip and he's into the race lead big gravel there between the two house cars as they Scrabble all over the road and that's hulkenberg losing positions and dropping down the order Magnuson gets by gazley gets by this gets very very tight for uh for George russle then he gets a good launch but the McLaren lock out that inside path the asri then oh squeezes wide and that is that is super tight there for Russell here's The Sensational move late on the breaks from piastri so close but fair between the two McLarens and it's just a beautiful move from piastri no sign of Team orders quite clearly for McLaren and it cost Norris another position the big lured slide through goes lir this is hulkenberg contact with Daniel Ricardo then he's going to scrape across the gravel through goes Kevin Magnuson and that put the dust on the racing line it's a 5-second Time penalty for Daniel Ricardo for forcing another car off the track this is going to be hogenberg trying a late send and making contact as a result that is pure frustration we go on board with the German driver trying to scrub off the Speed and hitting Yuki Coda never on from there here's the move for Sergio Perez he got a horrible amount of dirty air coming through the parabolica sent him wide through that corner but even with that he's able to move ahead into the breaking Zone and take seventh place and George Russell has gone from chasing third position trying to turn it into second position going long at the first corner of the racetrack and he's tumbled down to eighth position Kevin Magnuson fights his way by he's got past Daniel Ricardo at the rapo chicane the first one on the RAC trck Lando suggest we do box to over take on L cler box to so the call comes out oh he's hit the marker coming into the pits and I think he got away with it but was he over the pit lane speed limit well we'll find out pretty soon but that's a lack of concentration or a Dro in concentration for Lando it was a late call from the team let's see if it works out in comes charlot Clair trying to cover off that pit stop for McLaren also in Lewis Hamilton and he's powering through he's getting ahead there he is told you he was ahead we CAU it the end Lando Norris leaps up to what will become a net second place in the race this is Kevin Magnuson trying to pull off another overtake and this time wasn't as special as the move at the first sh in contact with Pierre gazley yep on that Dusty inside line locks up and it was always going to be contact if gazley didn't use the Escape roads nor is starting to struggle this is when Red Bull starting to have graining around lap 15 in the stint this is Geor Russell up against Sergio Perez Russell trying to go around the outside and again he's having to Scamper over the road at the first chicane he knows the Rules of Engagement though and he will have to give Perez the place back he does so is he going to try and do it in a way that gives him an opportunity to attack once again race control can sometimes be a bit sniffy about that if they don't feel you gave back the advantage and Russell stays behind he's on the charge though at the moment trying to take parez H this is Lando Norris now we're heading to the second chicane in fact on board with the driver who was second and having to go to the correct side of the bods and rejoin so it is a two- stopper unlike previous years he will get the rubber first and Lando Norris being held for a moment there 3.3 seconds Magnus back in the wars this time with Alex Alan consequential move that for Kevin Magnuson up four places from where he started the Grand Prix he hasn't scored a point here in a decade at Monza and he gets by Alex Alin who had pressure tires on the car on the canas oh my word George Russell trying to scrub off the Speed from 200 milph was eventually given the space by Sergio Perez and then deliberately ran it deep into the first turn to make a point I believe he's going to go wheel tohe with Sergio Perez once again battling over eighth position outside line for Perez can Russell keep a wheel in there and it's good speed for that Mercedes through goes George Russell and he's up to eighth we cut to Oscar piastri in the pits McLaren have dealt with the car have put on a new set of hard tires charir takes the lead of the Grand Prix I don't think this is working out well at all for McLaren Norris is barely quicker than llar and SS right now tucked in behind ven it's not working for them and that's a huge risk pitting piastri under no pressure in the race lead it's a huge risk cuz they've just handed Ferrari right now A onew and they can just see if they can make make these hard tires go to the end Oscar's got to unleash some serious Pace to go and catch them Norris going for it going past and that is a fairly efficient move I don't think foren can come back into turn number one by the time that we get to the second chicane there might be an opportunity McLaren need to put the hammer down now as Norris gets ahead of his rival for the championship the Ferrari clearly doesn't have the grip we don't see many passes for position into a scari it might be a to change Oscar pastri fights his way through to second place he's cleared one Ferrari the next one is denying him the top step for the second time in his career Lando norres got super close to Carlos signs not in the right part of the racetrack it is going to be third position fando Norris who started this race on pole he held the lead into turn number one but his teammate got by into the second chicane and since then piastri has been the lead McLaren he's bringing it right now he's only 2/10 off his best lap of the race charir there's not a huge sign of degradation for him and piastri on the last lap was only half a second quicker and he is right now doing everything right for a victory for Ferrari at Monza these are magical moments at Monza this did not seem possible when Charla Clair started fourth on the grid but it will be a season of Home victories for sh Clair the man from Monaco is the man for Monza the toosi are roaring him home and for the second time in his career Char Clair is the winner of the Italian Grand Prix for Ferrari he's won the race by 2.6 seconds for his seventh career Victory and it's won to saver what a drive what a driver and Ferrari this was a team a couple of years ago couldn't get a strategy right all season they were throwing races away and now they are team reformed and what a moment for Charlotte Clair and Formula 1 goes racing on the streets good reaction time for our poll sitter charlot CLA has the leaded the turn number one Oscar pastri is second there was a lock up for Sergio Perez but he wasn't able to take third place away How brave is he feeling into turn two there's your arm up to third position for Sergio Perez signs falls down to Fourth it's a good good getaway for Sergio Perez charl clir has the lead and then we're side by side further back and the stappord made a place on George Russell as well Russell trying to come back into turn three but he's too far back didn't have the fronts warmed up and both Red Bulls are gaining places this is Lance stroll he was in the middle of the pack at the time there's the contact they were close into three they were close into four and then eventually by the time they got to five contact Sona Clos the door Lance stroll has a puncher he was running close to Yuki sonoda earlier in the lap and Norris has gained two places we saw him behind Daniel Ricardo he's now past Ricardo and hulkenberg Lando Norris tried to gain another place Yuki Coda is in 11th that is hulkenberg trying to go around the outside and now Lando Norris who started this Grand Pre in 15th finds himself up three places but that was all caused by the punch of forance stroll and they bunched up as a result got to make moves quickly Lando norres trying to undo the damage of qualifying in his first q1 exit he's got Yuki sonoda off the racing line can't pass him into turn number one what about turn number two Lando Norris needs this and he's got it he moves up now to 11th Place on board with Lando Norris trying to make another pass and he's going to get it done on the breaks bman wise enough to know that his race is with other cars and it's another position gain Norris now up five places Lando can you do anything to hold peras up in the middle sector without hurting yourself yeah this lap that is Lando norres trying to protect his teammate second place at the moment from a hard charging Sergio Perez so you have to do it in the middle sector because if you try to do it on the straight you'll just get past slam dun that's going to happen anyway though isn't it yeah holding me yeah we see that and now pastri pits so they've had to use Norris as an emergency slow down Perez please cuz we've not covered him off when we should have done you're looking at the visor cam for Sergio Perez a master of these streets and he's trying to stand on the podium minimum again today who's on the exit of the corner though it's Oscar piastri with track position and Perez had the tire Advantage but Norris played the team game and piastri stays ahead for that time being pastri is coming and he's going to get the DRS right about now there's the over speed here's the chance for Oscar piastri How brave is he feeling on the breaks it's a dive bomb move it's a change of lead extraordinary stuff from the Australian sh Clair fights back but he can't take it back Oscar piastri on this set of tires has come alive and he's first in the race he's trying to break the toe this Grand Prix has gone electric and piastri still has the lead as they exit turn three absolute beauty of a move for the lead once again from Oscar piastri last week it was outside this week it's inside and lir thought he was too far back piastri thought otherwise smoked it in on the inside and he's through into the race lead but lir is well within DRS range at the moment Lando Norris is hanging on to it and defending heavily up against Max ven well it's worth more to norres to defend from vapen than it is to defend from SS oh he had to get out of the throttle the top two in the world championship nearly came to blows again oh yeah breaks are not working it's a scary one turn 15 you come over that Crest and the barrier greets you very quickly if you don't stop the car well enough he is an unfappable character Oscar piastri he always has been he's triying to win his second Grand Prix today but shac Clair has something to say about it the door was closed in shac Clair's face that's the closest he's been since he lost the lead pastri on the defensive wonderful battling for the win here in Baku it is game on for the lead of the Grand Prix that Gap is going to come down and down with every meter that they run to turn number one we're into DRS range are we going to have another change for the lead charl Clair wants that inside line he will not be given it and there's no room to go the long way round not this time but how about into turn two chop across from piastri now it really is gloves off piastri accelerating from a part of the racetrack that he didn't want to be in and yet he still got the lead of that Grand Prix Charla Clair in the Wheel tracks having to think about the risk versus rewards and the top three in the Grand Prix are now separated by 8/10 of a second on board with George Russell diving to the inside and Russell gets ahead it's that inside line that's the grippiest it's the inside line that gives George Russell P six I wondered how far they could take Lando Norris through this Grand Prix the answer is lap 38 they've taken it as far as they could look at these two in the land of fire driving the matches this is amazing can Maxa and keep behind his rival for the championship or is Lando Norris going to gain points up against the Red Bull driver there is the answer powering through and taking points out of the championship lead against all expectations Lando Norris moves up to sixth position kicking out the Dust In the late evening Sun who will be second going into turn number one Perez is powering through Perez has got them laid on the brakes llaa refuses to give it up and can caros Saints fight by yes well what a move it was nearly second for Perez but it's Carlos SS who gets by and this one's not over yet we're heading into the wall at high speed signs and Perez make Collision make a collision at high speed Perez is out he's out of the Grand Prix and on the penultimate lap of the race that's the moment that wins the Grand Prix for Oscar piastri first of all Perez attacking llaa and this was deep defense from charir who got down the inside and just forces Perez to check up a little bit now SS comes through and he's attacking lir but he gets wide on his teammate and he can't turn in he loses a load of front grip it allows Perez to come back through they're side by side it's so needless probably particularly on Perez who's got a clearer View and has space to just move to the left hand side what the you see VI man what the is he crazy or what idiot what happened there are you okay yeah but I don't get it the Oscar goes to the top step of the podium Oscar piastri wins the aaban Grand Prix and it will be a sequel to celebrate the Australian is a grand prix winner for the second time and what a day for McLaren all the Fallout from Monza how they lost the race this time they've won it the genius of piastri has won the race but with a red bull and a Ferrari crashing right at the end they lead the Constructor Championship and suddenly by a solid margin that is a grand prix with all the elements of a classic two drivers daring themselves to the limit of what is possible at the head of Motorsports Pinnacle moves on the edge eventually contact between Rivals Norris upending expectations to take three points out of the lead of Max stappen and the Singapore Grand Prix is underway good reaction time for Lando Norris who will hold the lead down to the 90 M to turn number one good start for Lewis Hamilton but Max has stavin edged him out off the road in the background goes Fernando Alonzo who now rejoins along with charlot Clair did they keep the right hand side of the Ballard otherwise race control will have a look top three top four as they were upper place on the opening lap goes Nico hulkenberg who is running in fifth position but Lando Norris got the launch that he needed canny bit all the way across the line on lap one for the first time in Formula One as piastri tries to dive to the inside and he takes back that place that he lost off the line it was a good launch from Norris this time for Sten couldn't get the the traction down and look at Hamilton has the better start of the top three it's not enough but he tries to go racing with theaa momentarily on the outside cannot make it through Russell and piastri were very very close as well which gave hulkenberg the door to come past the McLaren and that was hulkenberg briefly up into fifth place going to get a nice shot of it now looking back from George Russell starting fourth that's a nice angle isn't it you see the decision of the cars behind not as Dusty on that inside line as as maybe could be expected and then look how dusty it is offline though as um that Aston uses the Escape Road followed by the Ferrari as we see Oscar get that place back down in the breaking zone so he'll be relieved to have cleared that house so early alin's got an issue yeah we go on board with Alex Alin who wasn't happy at the start of the Grand Prix a drop back from where he had a chance to contend for points and now it looks like it's going to be another difficult day for the tie driver and that's Alex alurn out of the Singapore Grand Prix he is the first retirement front damage maybe maybe front damage well it's been a dream Grand Prix so far for Lando Norris but you're still pushing all the way here and on an old tire that's not in perfect condition maybe front wing damage was the call on the radio for the race leader here we go key moment on board with Lando Norris this could have changed the outcome of winner today this was back on lap 29 lock up and he brushes the barrier that was so close to the end of his Grand Prix wow wow wow and it shows how quickly things can change looking like a just you know stroke at home dominant position and then that under rotation in the front axle in a corner where there's no runoff right let's inspect what Lando Norris has got up the front High Press pit stop for McLaren they're trying to tick off the things might deny them Victory because the pace of the car with the driver that you're looking at has been superb and they'll be glad to be back into the Grand Prix that is laate on the break so position changed for Max a STA and he lost third on pit exit but those are fresh hard tires and he moves P charlot Clair so this is a high press stop they scrub off the Speed the team go to work stabilizing the car the new parelli fitted say goodbye to those mediums and now can the McLaren man with a 2.2 second Pit Stop get out ahead of Lewis Hamilton there goes one Mercedes that's George Russell here comes the second one it's going to be tight but it's going to be track position for the seven time world champion and Oscar piastri will have to go on the attack in the remaining laps of this race will he defend the inside forcing pastri around the outside in the brakes he does go around the outside that fresher R put to brilliant use and Oscar piastri clears the Mercedes at the first [Music] attempt Alonzo soaring left soaring right trying to keep the Ferrari behind but this time charlot Clair is able to get ahead entertaining battle between these two but charlot Clair moves on by dri is close we've got DRS again and he's really close look at this shot nibble of some curb little slide at the rear this is going to be a big chance now this is where he got leis Hamilton a couple of laps ago will he be forced to go the long way round again again he is but he pulls it off once more Russell hung in there but piastri gets past the second Mercedes up to third position this is on board with George Russell as piastri went by I love the Sparks Sparks in the face of the Hunter and uh well George we don't see from the angle he tried to hang in there there wasn't much room for his front Wing as they ran side by side through the Apex beautifully judged over this is on board with Daniel Ricardo heading through turn 10 and estan o on elbows his way by it's easy to forget oh so does so does Magnus W don't see too many coming through there sneaking past Norris oh did he tap the wall was that a a russle moment remember Norris did this on the final oh what is going on here's sh Clair we're on board we as the Ferrari driver goes through and up to fifth position and he will now try and close down that 8sec Gap as he gets past Lewis Hamilton and charlot Clair has gone from ninth on the grid to fifth in the race so this is the replay will this be the moment where brushes out well if that was the moment it was the tiniest of touches well you think how lucky so many other drivers have been because km mag is not the only d to be brushing that wall in fact be a rare driver that hasn't brushed a wall around this circuit today yeah that angle actually yeah it was a bit more obvious the contact let's see is this Russell brushing the wall I'll tell you what it's a sloppy one from George just exiting trying to get that steering wheel straight Co the rear tires back and literally just drives towards the barriers there on the outside and there is uh Kevin Magnuson who finds himself being pushed out of the Grand Prix Landon Norris can stop hearing about his starts and start enjoying his finishes for the third time in Formula 1 Lando Norris takes the checkered flag a dominant Drive complete he has taken points out of Max fappen who will come home in second place qualifying crucial yesterday but the margin comes down once again and Over The Line comes Max a stappen to claim second position and then a further 20 back it will be this man Oscar pastri who will find himself on the rostrom once again this year as he completes the final two corners and piastri will claim his seventh Podium finish of the Season across the line 13 for McLaren what mate good up yeah amazing car weekend thank you very much everyone one of any more let's keep pushing a third Grand Prix victory in Formula 1 for Lando Norris who beats Max aaen by just under 21 seconds Oscar piastri completes the podium George Russell had an entertaining battle and beat Charlotte clir to fourth place it means in the driver Championship the Gap has come down between vapen and Norris to 52 points as McLaren extend their lead in the Constructors Championship and the US Grand Prix is underway Max ain's going to give himself an opportunity into turn number one but Lando Norris is chopping across there's the late lunge that Max Sten was looking for but he says Lando Norris wi and through goes the Ferrari of sh Clair first and second battling each other and they open the door for the dri in The Scarlet car he rolls through up three places to take the lead of this one past his teammate past the top two in the battle for the world championship fappen is in second SS is in third and Norris on poter is down to P4 how many times have we seen those two go wheel tohe in a corner and have it go a little bit wrong for one or both it was a great jump off the line from lir anyway I think he cleared signs and then taking advantage of that opportunity presented by verstappen pushing Norris all the way out as we see them jocking for position now out of turn 11 down this long back straight look at L Hamilton already up a bunch of spots Louis Hamilton is up five places in 12th position Carlos SS says he go super Brave the answer is yes and now it's for stappen off the road he's been barged out of the way signs feathers back the throttle CU he knows he can't overtake him having cause that action but now at his favorite opportunity of all of them around the circuit he's tried to go by to turn 15 all the while knowing that he can't do it too quickly because vaben would be complaining all action start to this one in Austin Lon Norris got a decent launch but we wondered whether Max aaen was going to make that lunge come what may here was the answer I mean you never really have to wonder with Max do you he's going for it but it was that strong start from lir that got him on the inside of Carlos going into turn one fourth to First in one corner yeah I mean he's clearly pushed me out he had no intent to make the corner even he ran off the track so I just had to avoid uh crushing into him or him crushing into me but yeah and that was the original yellow flag okon getting spun around there will will just had Hamilton making a move up the inside albon getting into the side of okon and around he goes yellow flag in sector three oh big lock up off the road goes Lewis Hamilton Lewis Hamilton out of the US Grand Prix well let's quickly look here at what happened to Lewis Hamilton we're heading to turn 19 of the circuit let's listen in almost identical to what happened to George Russell doesn't make it to the barriers cuz you're going much slower in the race yeah sorry guys Max sten's G with his old racing rival slightly slow through turn 20 is there an opportunity for vapen to do what he did on the opening lap and dive to the inside it was a little bit of under steer through turn 20 it means that charlot Clair wasn't vulnerable through there he maintains the lead into turn number one it's charlot Clair Max stappen Carla SS and Lando Norris in fourth place this is on board with Liam Lawson the driver who currently occupies 12th position not being bullied by Fernando Alonso in the slightest my word what commitment that is from Liam Lawson oh spin there round goes Joe guu and he was in a great position running higher than he has done for a long time in Formula 1 but he finds himself spinning at the first turn Li Lawson Fernando Alonso back at it again down into turn 12 and the two that were arguing yesterday continuing the conversation this time on the racetrack and Lawson Powers ahead not intimidated by a two-time world champion and he's up to 11th Place 5-sec penalty has been awarded to George Russell for forcing another driver VY botas to be exact off the road so George we got a 5c penalty for forcing valry off the track what into the pits comes the Ferrari driver to say goodbye to the medium tires Ferrari deliver a sub 3 second stop big defensive move and looking for the inside finding the inside Franco kapino on the hard Tire waiting for the last possible moment to Lunge to the inside of Fernando Alonso alono on the medium colapinto climbing to the points that's another highlight moment for the driver who is just in his fourth start in Formula 1 when it comes to Grand Prix racing the world championship leader is into the pits for a high press Pit Stop Carlos SS is rounding the 20th and Final corner of the racetrack it's under 3 seconds but it is surely going to be track position for the Scarlet Ferrari that goes past the start Finish Line and by going to the rubber earlier for this moment of the race it's Advantage Carlos here's Liam Lawson who's finding himself now in 10th position because he's got past Pierre gazley and the man who has six grand prix to shine in Formula 1 improves to the points on those fresh medium tires How brave can he be in the breaking zone of turn 12 this is the best opportunity he's had since lap number one to take the place he puts the car on the outside line tries to duck back through it's not done yet for stappen knew it held on to the inside line and now off the racing line that he wants to be there's an opportunity the two contenders again separated by hardly anything traction race could favor the McLaren still it's side by side or very close to it but still it's for staing ahead with five laps to go Max a Staffing on the defensive Lando Norris on the attack Lando Norris going through on the breaks on can for STA and hang on to it he keeps his foot in they both go off the road Norris moves ahead for the first time since lap number one but he did so with all four wheels off the road that one surely will not count he will surely have to give the place back is the argument that Max forced him off the road though oh to me outside the track very matter of fact for Sten I'm sure Lando's going to say hey he forced me off the track we've seen both of those called Already it'll be interesting to see which way the FIA looks at this and the stewards want to address it I can't imagine McLaren will let the risk of a penalty hang over Lando Norris's head think goe let me know if you think otherwise they're still defending McLaren are going to risk the penalty they're still attacking each other McLaren are risking a 5sec penalty they've elected to keep track position did Lando Norris get ahead on the breaking Zone was he forced off the road we go on board with Lando Norris had an opportunity thought about the inside line there was a red ball in the way laid on the breakes you knew vapen was going to go as deep as possible and leaving the track and ging an advantage is under investigation for that moment lond Norris has a penalty for leaving the track and gaining an advantage he is 3o three seconds ahead of the stappen it will not be enough it was all about Max with the Sprint Lando took the pole Lando's got a penalty Carlos was the lead Ferrari on the grid but Sunday is all about charl another masterclass from Ferrari's favorite son sh Clair wins the US Grand Prix and that's my boy another win let's go I guess they got a 5sec penalty yeah they gave you 5 Seconds just up the there for leaving the track gaining an advantage oh yeah well then I should have just gone back behind him shouldn't I it's all about this man out front though Charla clir a grand prix winner for the third time this season it was a great battle between the top two in the world championship but it was resolved in Max V sten's favor 300 and 54 points to his name extending that advantage over Lando Norris he's on two 197 it is still McLaren out front 40 points ahead of Red Bull Racing with Ferrari closing [Music] in the battle towards turn one begins right now we leave the line for the Mexican Grand Prix and it's a good reaction time for Max a stappen he's got the inside line he's got the momentum He's Surely going to get the lead and now Lando Norris is going to try and power pass car signs as well but Sten has the inside line and the opportunity how braveful caros signs be an immediate spin into the barriers for the vcom off the road goes Carlos SS to maintain the lead and that will be an immediate intervention it was hard into the Armco it was a big moment into the barriers for Yuki Coda he was the driver involved there and Carlos SS feels the need to give the place back to Max EST staffen having jumped over the road but it's for STA and then signs then Norris lir Hamilton got past Russell it is an ambitious attempt from Cod there was barely any room there but in in the end it's uh it's an Unlucky One for Alin and for Coda who end up in a heap I don't think there was much Albin could do squeezed by gazley I don't blame gazley for that either gazley doesn't know that there's a a very opportunistic driver on the outside of the driver that's on the outside of him that contact between sonoda Albin and gazley was reviewed by race control it was noted no further investigation needed they called it a racing incident fastest lap for s who's responded then he's really close is he going to go for the late breaking move he is that's the lead for Carlos SS and he leaves turn two with the lead can he keep it by three maxen trying to apply the power there will be another DRS Zone which will take the Ferrari further away first opportunity offered up for Carlos SS and he took it with both hands St is close out of turn three Norris is really close behind Max as well just so impressed with SS ability on the brakes can Norris do the same this is brave from Lando Norris trying to go around the outside Max a stpp and barges his rival off the road and the contentious debate of position between the top two drivers in the world championship continues from Austin to Mexico City they Collide this time for stap and throwing it to the inside they're both off extraordinary elbows out brawling between the two of them and Char Clair takes advantage to go up to second position Norris is ahead coming into the corner but Max is good at having the shorter line and releasing the break at the moment so they are neck and neck but let's have a look once again at this part because now we're on the short burst up towards turn seven honestly that's a bit of a crazy one to send in a lunge on that corner with no hope of making the exit it's a hopeless lunge it's a 10-second time penalty for Max a stappen for forcing another driver off the track another 10-second time penalty for Max aaen for leaving the track and gaining an advantage let's see how aggressive the two Mercedes go wheel tohe defensive shape thrown by Lewis Hamilton Russell has the speed can he claim the place George Russell sweeps by outside line BEC comes the inside line BEC comes fifth position as the Mercedes went wheel tohe and Russell gets ahead Alonzo going deep into the pit box and retiring that is not the way he wanted to celebrate 400 Grand Prix weekends but Fernando Alonzo with an issue now turn four is an opportunity for Perez we're seeing so much overtaking that was a c withth but only just and now into another one of the stadium sections they've made contact and Lawson stays ahead moment of brinkmanship is the damage for Perez what the is this idot doing is he okay turn four is turning into a real overtaking opportunity today compared to what we normally see stroll now the Canadian trying that outside line again is he able to sweep by this time to turn the outside line to the inside perz doesn't want to give him any room and once again it's close to contact at the same Corner this is a long long wait so will'll be counting to 20 and then the signal will be given to the crew there it is and V stappen serving two penalties one for wheel banging at turn four one for going off the track and gaining an advantage at turn number eight as piastri tries to take the place from Pierre gazley and Pierre gazley is not interested in battling the McLaren one bit at all up to 10th goes pastri a reminder though colapinto still needs to stop this is Oscar piastri going late on the brakes looking for the move up against hulkenberg and he's able to make a tidy pass piastri improves up to eighth position and that is now nine places up from where he started the Grand Prix Magnuson on for his best result in Formula 1 since 2020 to he is having the time of his life out there oh Big Moment off the road and that's a huge moment of consequence off the road because it opens the door Lando Norris is through to second place and shla Clair is lucky that he didn't clatter into the Tech Pro the car control on this though snaking his way onto the dirt Norris is through lir was desperate for the traction because look how close Norris was coming out of here bit of whin how the Ferrari has any Wheels left on it look this is going to be millimeters for sh Clair and clobbering the barrier he gets on the power he loses the car Lando Norris is through to Second Place well George Russell has hung on lap after lap after lap to Fourth position but is that grip about to loosen the seven time world champion and two-time winner here gets a face full of Sparks goes around the outside and improves to Fourth Place the defense and ends at turn number one and Hamilton's 10 laps of hard work are rewarded he's now the lead Mercedes in the Grand Prix Franco kapino Liam Lawson and contact between the Williams and the New Zealander and that might be debie at turn 12 I gu he the same CR you watch the highlights later I'm wishing it not it will be only his fourth win in Formula 1 said poll yesterday was bittersweet because it gave him the feeling that Ferrari might be in a fight for a world championship and he won't be there to use it that realization ignited a fire today he knows the road back to the front might be long and winding with Williams but listen to this the sight and the sound of this crowd are claiming their winner Carlos SS comes out of the final corner for the final time Carlos SS wins the Mexico City Grand Prix a fine way to take a fourth career Victory it will be a 10-point swing in the dri's world championship after Lando Norris finishes in second and Charla Clair is setting purple sectors rapid sectors to give Ferrari a third place and a bonus point in the Formula 1 World Championship battle for Constructors that looks like it's going to be fought between Ferrari and McLaren all the way to dabby your Podium completed by sh clir with the fastest lap of the race and the point that goes with it yes this is Master Class Carlos dominant weekend UMO good job yes yes make a good weekend caros thank you this feels good four of February graat Mexico well sometimes in Formula 1 the most complex of sports it can be about so much and you just got the feeling that Carlos SS was driving with desire four grand PR remain two sprint races and this 2024 season will not relent action all the way from lights out to the waving of the checkered flag Lance stroll finds himself off the road on the formation lap and he has got himself into difficulty at turn number four I think we're going to need an aborted start here uh because he's stuck in the gravel and for the second year in a row a car finds themselves out on the formation lap we're down to 70 laps for the Grand Prix the start is aborted a second formation lap now in progress was also parked at the wrong grid slot yeah all sorts of procedures have been breached here Max should not have started yeah you have to wait for a green light Lando Norris noted for a starting procedure infringement did Lando begin the second formation that before the green lights were illuminated the sou Paulo Grand Prix is underway from the line good reaction time for George Russell the lead for George Russell the Mercedes man gets by estan okon forces his way past the two V CBS or at least he's trying to Yuki sonoda hangs on to third position as Lewis Hamilton is all over the curb here is Oscar pastri toughing it out with Fernando Alonso in the green Aston Martin and now you've got pastri moving out of the Wheel tracks they're on the intermediate tires they're looking for a way by this is to turn number four this is a chance for Fernando Alonzo wide moment now for Liam Lawson allows Alonzo to keep the place on the way in but pastri kept it pinned on the way out and he's able to go past the two-time world champion now side by side the saber on the H oi bman trying to hold on that position and round goes Cheo Sergio Perez spins round the Red Bull keeps the engine going and he will rejoin Norris again cannot convert into leading lap one of the contest and through the spray having a go at Lewis Hamilton fighting his way through and taking 10th Place the man on the charge the championship leader on the attack Max a Sten up to P10 let's have a look at Oliver bman he got a penalty 10-second time penalty for causing a collision only we have a 10sec penalty for the collision with kapino right he didn't even lose any time Max a stappen looking to make another move up against Pierre gazley and V stappen comfortably takes ninth position that was a replay of Max staffen getting past Fernando Alon here we go with Max Sten in another league right now wasn't even a contest the man showing us why he's a three-time world champion Max for St hasn't won since the Spanish Grand Prix and there won't be a contest there that's the junior team not fighting the senior team another position gained Lawson knows who he wants to join next year and he doesn't fight it piastri I believe on Lawson so yeah this was the spin round for Liam Lawson from Oscar piastri and he got a 10-second penalty for this hulkenberg a spun I can see it out of the commentary box window there he is as the rain hammers down and hulkenberg usually so reliable when the rain is gone off and the leaders make it through it's getting right on the limit this is all about keeping the car pointing in the right direction the virtual safety car is out to neutralize the race control Al delete and we go again all right well done George Russell cannot cope with the car on the circuit any longer the top two felt the need to come into the pits and take on new tires and Russell gets out ahead estan okon rolls the dice he's hoping now for a full stoppage with these conditions look at the water on the racetrack they have absolutely got to be contemplating calling this one which would be devastating for Russell and Norris and look at the plumes of spray look at Lando Norris going through it's barely rable out there but the British driver gets past his countryman that is a crucial move to move up to Fourth position and the safety car is finally deployed to neutralize the race big crash into the wall for Franco kapino colapinto finds the barriers it is a red flag the race is interrupted with estan OK on the leader but that is how easy it is and look at the damage it did confirmation that hulkenberg received outside assistance which is why he was shown the Black Flag at that flag is to disqualify a driver from the race estan oon takes us back to racing conditions and there's a good opportunity further back in the pack for a pass side by side moves further back but the top five are in the same order charlot Clair got up to P six Lawson completing the point scorers at the moment and off the row goes Lando Norris Lando Norris can he stay ahead of George Russell they go into turn number five a moment of massive consequence and who's going to get the inside line into the highp speed Corner Norris has to back out of it on the outside to take the place goes George Russell the different risk level being taken and there's the evidence off the road into the TAC runoff for Oliver bman who nudges the barriers can he escape from there to keep his race going but you could see some drivers were cautious some were attacking and for bman that's the result the tires on Lando Norris had six everybody had six they all changed during that red flag oh and we see the Ferrari going into the wall Carlos SS can't keep it on the road and he spins into the barrier to bring out the safety car once again and just immediately rear lock up into eight that was a big hit Aon leaving it late but Aon leaving the field behind they're very tightly bunched up in the background there's a big opportunity for charlot Clair there's a big opportunity for George Russell but a better one for Max V stappen who finds himself taking the lead as or Lando Norris has gone off the road the championship pendulum swings in one corner piastri gets past Norris who drops down to seventh position as for stappen goes from 17th on the grid to the lead in Brazil as Hamilton defending now against Liam Lawson at the top part of the racetrack and now Lawson coming back on the inside into turn eight can he find his way past Hamilton Hamilton's deep Hamilton's nearly off Alonzo is off as well and gaining another place you see the command now from McLaren to swap positions that was expected they didn't wait too long which is the right thing to do now Lando's got to be head down attacking Russell and that's Russell up to Fourth and Russell is able to get par sh Clair don't expect that to be an issue Russell didn't have to lift didn't have to go off track to avoid the Ferrari so no harm no foul there in the Brazilian Reign the Dutchman has delivered a defining drive he climbs the hill back to Grand Prix Victory Max ven wins the South Paulo Grand Prix in 2024 17th on the grid to the win and punching the air with delight is estan okon who takes his fourth career Podium and he will be joined by his teammate for his fifth career Podium and for the first time in 11 years team endstone have both cars on the podium a defining win for the world championship that leaves him with a 62-point lead his first Grand Prix victory since back in June and it was worth the wait roaring through the field in some style if Max beats Lando tonight he's champion of the world here are the liks we're underway in Las Vegas and racing to turn number one with George Russell holding the lead the battle is between gazley and SS and they open the door for charlot Clair to go from fourth potentially to Second there's no grip off line Ferrari versus Ferrari and around the outside to tp2 goes the man fourth on the grid charl clir Roars up to Second George Russell holds a lead down goes signs down goes gazley for Sten is still ahead of Lando Norris having left the line but it's Russell P1 it was very close behind as well with Norris there's Yuki coda in there with the Oscar piastri as well but crucial for Ferrari they've got ahead of gazley and that might allow a bit of a buffer back to the main contenders behind but staing stuck behind gazley for now it reminds me a little bit of Montreal the middle part of the lap as Charles lir goes for the move oh there was always going to be an opportunity for multiple overtakes there Russell defends P1 but gazley could not defend P4 it's game on at the front of the field we raw through the 17th and final corner of the racetrack look at this scene between Mercedes and Ferrari separated by hardly anything there's no grip around the outside surely and George Russell stays ahead but he's under massive pressure from the Scarlet Ferrari Lewis Hamilton fighting his way past the McLaren or at least trying to terrific pitches at enormous speed the Australian driver on the left hand side as out front Carlos SS has fought his way up to second position charlot Clair is gone from contending for the lead of this Grand Prix to losing second position and a man from the front row who lost second at the start has reclaimed it wow it's a case of keeping the tires in the window if you fall out you chew through them quickly and having look like he was going to take the lead of the Grand Prix a couple of laps ago charlot clir is now going to Tumble off the podium through goes the championship leader Max stappen up to third one Ferrari moves up to second one drops down to Fourth it's Mercedes ahead of Ferrari ahead of Red Bull now the podium contenders still four in the battle for the win Norris gets past gazley he has moved up to fifth position it's Russell then signs then V stappen well we had a slightly mixed up grid because of qualifying in very low conditions it's still only 17° track temperature out there and Hamilton's making use of these conditions charlot Clair has been called in to the pits Lewis Hamilton is gaining another place 10th on the grid to seventh in the Grand Prix at the moment this is such a pleasure to ride on board with b stappen and when you're sitting in that cop he's going to blast pass sign say this is going to be a slam dunk move when he opens the DRS and science just has to wait in all the apexes to actually rotate the car interesting comparison between the straight line speed of the Ferrari without DRS took a while for vapen to get by signs will be pitting he's got no tires left Lewis Hamilton has claimed fourth position L for L for everything's looking okay for us we hit the limiter take the car it's an expiring power unit in the back of his Alpine and after being one of the stars of the qualifying hour the man who started third on the grid comes into the pits to retire Carlos s sweeping past Sergio Perez up to third place Perez yet to stop this is more important though this is a straight fight that's Lewis Hamilton late on the breaks that's Lewis Hamilton past Lando Norris and that is for sixth position we are reaching a point for the leaders to make their second stop and signs being told to swap positions that's one thing to issue the instruction might be another thing to let both cars buy how does he do this through goes lir that was well driven from Carlos s what a tough position he was put in charlot Clair goes through signs hangs on to Fourth but only surely for a few meters does he peel into the pits he does ahead of Lewis Hamilton synchronized swimming ah he's gone deep he's gone on and he's cut the line as he does so that was a strange one on board with Lewis Hamilton and SS just carry Straight on now he pits and that's going to cost SS a lot what happened ready wake up guys come on the team of OB said stay out stay out and uh so he's reacted to the team that is a major mistake for Ferrari and now Hamilton is well up the road 3 seconds up the road as SS finally gets back onto the track charlot Clair has been called to the pitch from second so this is now the battle for P2 leis Hamilton's got the speed look at the speed he has got 216 mph and he moves up to third that will become second and it will shake out to be a Mercedes onew no contest between the two greats for stappen and Hamilton now one Ferrari with cold tires one Ferrari with fired up tires one Ferrari with a fired up driver and signs will get the inside line and fourth position as he goes past Charla Clair these two have been passing and repassing all day oh Perez trying to go P two of them in one corner and doing so it's been a terrible season those are his words but he absolutely roared by there two for the price of one to get past Lawson and Magnuson with one of the moves of the Grand Prix so far Brave on the braks and he probably didn't expect both places to be up for up for opportunity and then manages somehow to find his way through without contact DRS open for the rapid Ferraris can vapen do anything about it we know he's going to fight it but can he fight it here we go on the brakes for Carlos sign to get by and vapen could not defend when it came to the breaking one Ferrari goes through hulkenberg trying to go past up to eighth position to take a point away from his Japanese rival crucial for H to be best of the rest if they want to claim sixth position next car to lap for George Russell is Liam Lawson then L Str then you get to a battle to the inside and claiming the position is sh Clair the defense for the man who will win the title in a few laps time is over for the Ferraris both SIDS and lir go through out of the penultimate Corner he's left the entire Field behind he'll convert his Pole Position to Victory the British driver will look up and see the checkered flag first he punches the air as George Russell wins the Las Vegas Grand Prix the third time in Formula 1 he's taken the checkered flag it's second place for Lewis Hamilton Carlos sides will complete the podium but further back the Dutch driver will retain his crown Max for stappen is a four time Formula 1 World Champion Max ven is the champion of 2024 and after a midseason spent in limitation he was burdened until the Brilliance of Brazil he now has the title in his grasp once again in 2024 Max fappen would not be moved and that is four in a row max four in a row congratulations oh my God man on the season four times thank you guys thank you to everyone I mean it was a little bit more difficult than last year but we pulled through and we gave it all thank you so much guys the day that V stappen SES to four is Las Vegas under the lights after the Brilliance in Brazil just needed a fifth place and to beat his nearest rival the driver who currently has a car third in the constructor's championship has taken the driver's Crown again final car in place means we get the green flag of the back here come the lights in sail and the Qatar Grand Prix is underway George Russell launches off the line he'll have to chop across Max Sten who's got good momentum he's got the inside line he's got the lead of the Grand Prix Lando Norris fighting on the inside as well Lando's going past the pair of them how did he do that he didn't do that because V staffen managed to get his elbows out a pulse it to FS to third it's for stappen and Norris at the head of the field with Max aaen going willto whe with his rival for the title early this year here but it's P2 on the grid that penalty Avenged immediately as vaben gains a place Russell loses two positions Norris gains a place as well and off into the background one of the hes surely of Kevin Magnuson Aon and Kinto stranded at turn one and they are out at the first turn aon's going to dive round the outside at the first corner and hul's just got absolutely no grip so he's already locked up the right front he's got Alex Alin just ahead and he's nervous about hitting the Williams then is having to turn and that causes the spin let's have a look so he's on the brakes there's Albin oh he's just got he's got no grip on that hard Tire Round goes Alburn further on lap one massively hit my Str yeah copy that I knew he was going to do it I tell there's a 10-second time penalty for Lance stroll for causing a collision I think that's a racing incident in my eyes the incident involving leis Hamilton for a potential false start is under investigation yeah sorry about that guys so he's rolling as the lights go out that's going to be a slam dunk I'm fairly sure the green flag flies at L International once again and piastri is very close to lir that seems to be the closest one George Russell's also got a run on Lando Norris let's see whether the moves are going to change they are debating fourth place and they stay as they were into turn one pastri pass lir lir understeered at the final corner just couldn't get through but he does back on the inside and off the road in the background we go in Liam Lawson and so Liam Lawson is heading off the road to Tumble down the order it's a 10-second time penalty for Liam Lawson for causing a collision at the first turn and this is the overtake for Kevin Magnuson Yuki says go the long way round and Kevin Magnuson is going to oh fruity stuff from km mag he's forced wide keeps his foot in over the gravel and then with a bit of gravel jumps back up the inside it's a lovely pass now from what we can see sten's tires similar to ours Russell behind slightly worse than ours lovely move around the outside and Yuki Cod offering that inside move Pierre gazley going for the grippy racing line and taking the place and once again Yuki trying to shut the door and if it's straight line speed problems that Fernando Alonzo has he's got plenty of grip to go around the outside again and first Magnuson then gazley and now Fernando Alonzo go the long way around to take the place away from Yuki Russell gets a new set of pelli tires and it's not quick it wasn't quick on the front right it wasn't quick on the front rear and I think he's going to come out now Behind These Guys where without that slow stop he would have slotted out in front of them so was that is it Alin was that the H it's either the Williams or the H they've both been whacked in the Grand Prix so it could have been either Che if be lifted for the yellow there was a yellow in the middle of the street yeah there was we'll have a look make sure he lifted let's listen in then as he's going to blast past this check the board Lando did not lift oh you and then that murder has been hit has it done any damage I wouldn't expect too much damage that said that looks like a lot of Dey From Below Hilton FIS Hamilton off the road well it coincides with all those shards of carbon fiber being deposited all over the start finish straight As botas cream through that that another one another one this time for Carlos SS the mirror on the racing line and Carlos SS has a puncher two cars on one lap so max EST stappen has headed the race since lap number one took the lead at the start Lando Norris nearly jumped from third to first but the staffen had the inside line for turn number two uh Hamilton speeding 100% he just break tested me again I lock both my friends there is a drive-through penalty for Lewis Hamilton for speeding in the pit Lane Perez is dropped down that's not a transponder issue Perez is no longer in the point we are racing again in lale perfect restart fando norres yeah terrible restart from Max Fen based on his previous ones he's under pressure side by side we go for the gr PRI Victory Fen versus Norris at the turn one and they'll both be going deep Fen hangs on to it they went whe to wheel again and ven hangs on to first place piastri gave it everything to get parir he couldn't get there ven maintains the lead there's still moves going on they're still swapping it over can lir hang on to it he can pastri is still in P4 you've got Russell in fifth under pressure from Carlos signs for stappen elbows out once again gazley gets past SS he's up to sixth position this is Sergio Perez let's listen in uh his hard tires not warming up you could hear the Rev Spike as he went for it I that was driver error that's hulkenberg dropping the car spinning into the gravel it was a great Sprint race for him ever since we went to the Grand Prix format it's not been his weekend it's a 10c stop go penalty for Lando Norris for failing to slow under yellow flags that is effectively a 35 second penalty for Lando Norris it's out of the points given how many laps is going to be left in this Grand Prix Kevin Magnuson oh he's not going to go around the outside he was barged out of the way before and that was a look at how Alex Alber and him went racing these two gloves off stuff and this is even better news for Joe who's sitting up the road in eighth place here we go again between alurn and Magnuson that is a roar around the outside what a great move from a man heading out of Formula 1 in a week's time go nice one Kev every Point counts for McLaren still so they even though they're going to be outraged with what's happened they're going to really need that extra point they'll be happy with gle's job as well keeping SS at Bay still for fifth and sixth place Lando Norris massively massively fighting and getting past valter botas crucially that gets him one point for 10th and one bonus point for fastest lap if stay the way they are the Dutch driver will see The Checkered Flag first and Max vaben cruises over the line to win his ninth Grand Prix of the Year Max for stappen wins the Qatar Grand Prix Charlotte Clair comes home in second place Oscar piastri completes the podium and we will see you next week for a title fight between McLaren and Ferrari and welcome back to the top 10 Joe guu and salba they finally scored in 2024 there were spins there were overtakes there were penalties and there was victory for the world champion once again Max aaen taking a big glug celebrating and it has been an Illuminating kind of night it is time to answer the final question of the Season who will we call the champion Constructor of the world and the season finale is is underway good launch off the line for the two McLaren cast th on the grid dropping down there is really is Yugi on a crash and turn one contact massive contact Oscar piastri making contact with the Red Bull as they flash through it's land Norris with the lead then Carlos SS up to third goes Pierre gazley in fourth goes George Russell but a dramatic moment as p asri and v Sten come together yeah Max Fen brilliant getaway off the line made quick work of Carlos signs and then rather than taking the cautious cautious approach into turn one he sent it I don't think the pastri knew he was coming not sure did as we see a battle now that's one of the H that's Magnus trying to go by Perez up the inside into six and he gets the move done Brave on the breaks in his final start in Formula One and round he goes Perez spins a wild opening lap of the Grand Prix yeah so ven's made short work of signs who's a bit tardy and this is where the surprise comes he sends it and realizes that Oscar has given him a bit of space but just the momentum of that Red Bull was always going to drift wide and the contact was definitely made Red Bull to McLaren and we now know that Bin's given a 10-second penalty for this contact this was on the first lap super late breaking move from Magnuson and then the contact between botas and Perez is how Perez went round Perez would then lose drive from the car and park up botas has been penalized with a 10-second time penalty for that moment wellis is on board with Oscar pastre as he tries to find his way past to Williams Oh big contact and how did that not rip the front Wing off penalty there for piastri causing a collision so his day going from bad to worse with that that was a late send from charlot Clair and Kevin Magnuson saw it coming opened up the steering got him back on the exit but that Ferrari is roaring on by and Charlotte Clair is gone from the back grow the grid up to seventh position as Ferrari continue to fight for this constructor's title lir will be believing he can quickly clear the Aston Martin and Fernando Alonzo is outside of DRS for hulkenberg it means he doesn't get it but charlot Clair did the Ferrari screams by and charlot Clair has gone from 19th on the grid to sixth position in the Grand Prix Lando Norris is being told and is managing his tires at the moment as we see Max aaen getting to the inside and it's the same order for the house and the Ferrari but aaen gets past the green Aston Martin and on the exit of the corner the order changes up to fifth place this is some attacking drive from charlot clir as Hamilton gets past Lawson and now three moves into that corner that could be defining for later on this isn't really working out for lir now being stuck behind gazley we saw as he makes the move now down into turn six DRS nothing gazley can do on those older tires the car dropped down was sent and the front left was not tight yeah it didn't look right certainly when the car hit the ground and that's kind of where the driver's looking you're looking a little bit out to the leftand side out into the into the pit lane or the fast lane there so he would have noticed that right away had that been the right front maybe not I guess gazy doesn't have DRS so it's going to be a little bit easier than what we saw before and yeah he doesn't defend after how many laps he had to try it around the outside and look at the back of that Alpine I was surprised he didn't just go for it but obviously it worked out there and hearing that we're cut into Kevin Magnus de on the circuit so there's a spin for Kevin Magnuson that we caught late and a part of his car has gone and there's a puncher for valry botas in what could be his final Grand Prix in Formula 1 lock up for valry botas oh my word huge lock up and contact between the salba and the h y on the inside yeah just no front grip we h heard earlier in the Grand Prix I think it was Louis Hamilton talking or was it Max caen saying just couldn't break into the corners as you get those front tires not quite working oh isn't that just great two drivers looking at their last Grand Prix start to have it end like that is is really unfortunate for both Ferrari making progress from where they were last year when Mercedes beat them to the punch Mercedes were second last year Ferrari were third looks like they're going to upgrade but not to the position they want to be talking of upgrade Max staffen easily by Fernando Alonzo now finds himself recovering up to eth laid on the brakes for Lewis Hamilton he'll be enjoying this feeling he fights it getting the power on as he gets past and he moves up to sixth position past Nico hulkenberg FL 46 of 58 we're coming to the end of an extraordinary season with seven different winners as the Red Bull easily slides past the Alpine there up into the sixth position might have to wait until he gets to a whoa he lost the air on the front wing and piastri gathered it together getting too close to the back of the vov well every day it's a school day and he'll just have leared that and banked it away for the future and let's see with the help of DRS whether he can reverse what happened to him one lap ago no can't go for the overall speed but he feels he's got the confidence to run to the outside better grip does he have the RO that's a great way to fire Yourself by up into 11th place and this is a easy pass to break Williams Hearts piastri recovers to the points and Alban's chance of that first point score since Baku disappears as Norris pushes on through turn 13 and 14 Hamilton will take the battle to turn number nine on the last lap but this is the moment that McLaren dreamed of Lon Norris wins the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix McLaren are world champions of 2024 they win the constructor's title for the first time since 1998 around the outside goes Lewis Hamilton in the left hand side he on screen and he's roared around the outside to take fourth away from George Russell what a move in his last drive for Mercedes he was never going to accept finishing behind his teammate Carlos SS has come home in second completing the podium and climbing 16 places will be sh Clair and Lewis Hamilton up 12 completes his attacking stint with Mercedes after a decade in the doldrums a season to remember for one of formula 1's most famous Constructors we did it mate we did it world champions well [Music] done papaya R to incredible what everyone so proud of you all thank you so much it's been a special year next year is going to be my year too 84 wins 78 pole positions and 153 podiums a standout stint in Formula 1 like no other Hamilton and Mercedes sign off in style and the top two teams in the world championship it's like times of old Ferrari and McLaren another title for the famous team restored to the top of the Formula 1 World Championship and McLaren
